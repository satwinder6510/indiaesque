**October to March is the best time to visit Jaipur, with comfortable temperatures between 15-25°C (59-77°F). This period offers perfect weather for exploring palaces and forts without the scorching summer heat that reaches 45°C (113°F).**

## Peak Season: October to March

The winter months transform Jaipur into a traveler's paradise. October kicks off the season with temperatures dropping from summer's brutal highs to a pleasant 20-30°C (68-86°F). By December and January, you'll enjoy cool mornings at 8-12°C (46-54°F) and comfortable afternoons around 22-25°C (72-77°F).

This weather makes exploring the [top attractions in Jaipur](/jaipur/) enjoyable. You can spend hours at Amber Fort or City Palace without feeling drained by heat. The clear skies provide excellent photography conditions, especially for the iconic Hawa Mahal and Jal Mahal.

### Festival Season Magic

Winter coincides with Rajasthan's major festivals. Diwali (October/November) lights up the Pink City with spectacular decorations. The entire old city around Johari Bazaar and Bapu Bazaar sparkles with diyas and rangoli patterns.

Teej festival (August/September) celebrates the monsoon's arrival with colorful processions through MI Road. Pushkar Fair (November) happens just 150km away, making it easy to combine with your Jaipur visit.

## Summer Season: April to June (Avoid)

Summer in Jaipur is punishing. April starts the heat wave with temperatures hitting 35-40°C (95-104°F). May and June are worse, with mercury soaring to 45°C (113°F) or higher. The sun beats down mercilessly from 10am to 6pm.

Walking through Jaipur's stone palaces becomes unbearable. The sandstone absorbs heat, making indoor temperatures feel like ovens. Even early morning visits to Nahargarh Fort leave you exhausted by 9am.

Local life adapts completely. Markets close from noon to 4pm. Street food vendors disappear during peak hours. Your [planned itinerary](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/) will need constant modifications around the heat.

## Monsoon Season: July to September

Monsoon brings mixed blessings. Temperatures drop to 25-35°C (77-95°F), providing relief from summer's fury. The city turns green as rain washes away dust and brings gardens to life.

However, humidity stays high at 70-80%. Rain arrives in sudden, heavy bursts that flood streets within minutes. The narrow lanes around City Palace and Jantar Mantar become waterlogged. Many outdoor activities get cancelled or postponed.

Infrastructure struggles during heavy rainfall. Roads near Sanganer Airport flood regularly. Auto-rickshaws and taxis charge premium rates during rain. Your [transportation options](/jaipur/getting-around-jaipur/) become limited.

## Hotel Pricing Throughout the Year

Hotel rates fluctuate dramatically with seasons. Peak winter months (December-January) see luxury hotels charging ₹8,000-12,000 ($95-145) per night. Budget accommodations near MI Road range from ₹2,500-4,000 ($30-48).

Shoulder months (October-November, February-March) offer better deals. The same luxury hotels drop rates to ₹5,000-8,000 ($60-95). Mid-range options around Tonk Road cost ₹2,000-3,500 ($24-42).

Summer brings massive discounts but unbearable conditions. Five-star properties near C-Scheme slash rates to ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60). Budget hotels go as low as ₹1,200-2,000 ($14-24). Monsoon pricing sits between summer lows and winter highs.

Book accommodations 2-3 months ahead for peak season. Festival periods like Diwali see prices spike 50-100% above normal rates. [Choosing the right area to stay](/jaipur/where-to-stay-jaipur/) becomes crucial during peak season when availability shrinks.
