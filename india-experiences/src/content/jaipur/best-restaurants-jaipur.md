## Booking and Practical Information

Most fine dining restaurants in Jaipur require advance reservations, especially during wedding season (November-February) when the city fills with celebration dinners. Call directly rather than relying on online booking platforms, which often show incorrect availability.

Heritage hotels typically require 48-72 hours notice for their specialty restaurants. Rooftop venues like 1135 AD and Peacock Rooftop book up quickly during sunset hours (6-8 PM).

Payment options vary - luxury hotels accept international credit cards, while local restaurants prefer cash or Indian debit cards. ATMs are readily available throughout the city if you need to withdraw rupees.

When planning your [dining itinerary](./food/), consider that many restaurants close between lunch and dinner service (3-7 PM). This timing works well for afternoon sightseeing before evening meals.
