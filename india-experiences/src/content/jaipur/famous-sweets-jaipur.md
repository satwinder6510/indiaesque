**Jaipur's most famous sweets include ghewar (a monsoon specialty), feeni (crispy sugar threads), and mawa kachori (sweet stuffed pastry). You'll find the best versions at legendary shops like LMB, Rawat Mishthan Bhandar, and Annapurna Bhandar, with prices ranging from ₹50-300 per kg.**

Jaipur's sweet shops have been perfecting their recipes for generations, creating confections that locals crave and tourists remember long after their visit. These aren't just desserts – they're edible pieces of Rajasthani culture that reflect the region's royal heritage and seasonal traditions.

## Ghewar: The Monsoon Marvel

Ghewar stands as Jaipur's most iconic sweet, traditionally prepared during monsoon months (July-September) for festivals like Teej and Raksha Bandhan. This disc-shaped confection features a honeycomb-like texture created by pouring batter into hot ghee, then soaking it in sugar syrup.

**LMB (Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar)** on Johari Bazaar serves the city's most celebrated ghewar. Their plain ghewar costs ₹200 per kg ($2.40), while mawa ghewar reaches ₹300 per kg ($3.60). The shop offers special packaging for travelers – sturdy cardboard boxes that protect the delicate structure during transport.

**Annapurna Bhandar** near Hawa Mahal specializes in malai ghewar, topped with thick cream and dry fruits. Prices range from ₹250-350 per kg ($3-4.20), and they'll vacuum-seal larger orders for international travel.

Most shops stop making ghewar after September, though LMB produces it year-round due to tourist demand. The texture becomes softer during humid months, making monsoon ghewar superior to off-season versions.

## Feeni: Crispy Sugar Artistry

Feeni resembles spun gold – thin, crispy threads of gram flour deep-fried and coated in sugar syrup. This labor-intensive sweet requires skilled hands to create the hair-thin strands that melt on your tongue.

**Rawat Mishthan Bhandar** near Sindhi Camp produces Jaipur's finest feeni. Their master halwai (sweet maker) creates batches fresh each morning, selling for ₹180 per kg ($2.15). The shop packages feeni in airtight containers that preserve crispiness for up to two weeks.

**Chappan Bhog** on MI Road offers premium feeni with silver leaf (varak) for ₹250 per kg ($3). They provide special travel boxes lined with tissue paper – essential since feeni crumbles easily.

Order feeni early in the day when it's freshest. Afternoon humidity can make it lose its characteristic crunch, especially during monsoon months.

## Mawa Kachori: Sweet Surprise

Don't confuse this with savory kachori – mawa kachori is a sweet pastry filled with condensed milk (mawa), nuts, and cardamom, then deep-fried and dusted with powdered sugar.

**Rawat Mishthan Bhandar** created this specialty and remains the undisputed champion. Each kachori costs ₹80-120 ($0.95-1.45) and weighs about 100 grams. They fry batches throughout the day, so you'll always get fresh ones.

The outer shell stays crispy for hours while the mawa filling remains soft and aromatic. Unlike other sweets, mawa kachori travels well and tastes good at room temperature.

## Seasonal Availability and Planning

Ghewar season runs July-September, peaking during Teej (usually August). Book advance orders during festivals as shops sell out quickly. Many families order 5-10 kg for celebrations.

Feeni and mawa kachori are available year-round, but quality peaks during cooler months (October-March) when humidity doesn't affect texture.

## Travel and Packaging Tips

Most established shops provide travel-friendly packaging at no extra cost. Request vacuum sealing for international travel – it extends shelf life from 1 week to 3-4 weeks.

Ghewar requires careful handling due to its delicate structure. Ask shops to place cardboard separators between layers in the box.

Carry sweets in your cabin luggage rather than checked bags to prevent damage from rough handling.
