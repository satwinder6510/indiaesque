**Jaipur Junction (JP) is the main railway station serving Jaipur, located in the heart of the city on Station Road. The station connects to major cities across India, with auto-rickshaws costing ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) to reach the city center and Pink City attractions.**

Jaipur Junction handles over 200 trains daily and serves as the primary gateway for tourists visiting Rajasthan's capital. The station underwent major renovations in recent years, improving passenger facilities and platform infrastructure.

## Station Location and Layout

Jaipur Junction sits on Station Road in the central part of the city, making it easily accessible from most hotels and tourist areas. The station has 6 platforms connected by two foot overbridges and one subway.

The main entrance faces Station Road, while the secondary entrance opens to Gopinath Marg. Platform 1 is closest to the main entrance, with platforms 2-6 extending northward. Each platform displays clear signage in Hindi and English.

The station building houses ticket counters, waiting rooms, and commercial spaces on the ground and first floors. Platform 1 has the longest length and typically handles premium trains like Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express services.

## Transportation from the Station

### Auto-Rickshaw Stands

Three auto-rickshaw stands operate outside Jaipur Junction. The prepaid auto-rickshaw counter near the main exit offers fixed rates: ₹100-150 ($1.20-1.80) to City Palace area, ₹150-200 ($1.80-2.40) to Hawa Mahal, and ₹120-180 ($1.45-2.15) to most central hotels.

Regular auto-rickshaws queue along Station Road, but you'll need to negotiate fares. Expect to pay similar rates, though drivers often quote higher prices initially. The prepaid service eliminates haggling and provides a receipt with the driver's details.

### Prepaid Taxi Services

The prepaid taxi counter operates 24/7 from a booth outside the main entrance. Rates start at ₹200 ($2.40) for nearby destinations within 5km, ₹300-400 ($3.60-4.80) to Pink City attractions, and ₹500-700 ($6-8.40) to outer areas like Amber Fort.

Air-conditioned taxis cost 20-30% more than non-AC vehicles. You can book Uber and Ola rides from the designated pickup point near the taxi stand, though surge pricing applies during peak hours.

### Local Buses

JCTSL (Jaipur City Transport Services Limited) buses stop at the station road bus stand, 200 meters from the railway station. Bus routes 1, 2, and 5 connect to major city areas for ₹10-25 ($0.12-0.30) per ride.

For travelers heading to [tourist attractions](getting-around-jaipur/), auto-rickshaws and taxis provide more convenience than local buses, especially with luggage.

## Station Facilities

### Waiting Rooms

The first floor houses both AC and non-AC waiting rooms. The AC waiting room charges ₹30 ($0.36) per person for 6-hour slots, with extensions available for ₹15 ($0.18) per additional 3 hours. The non-AC waiting room provides free access for passengers with confirmed tickets.

Both waiting rooms have separate sections for families and ladies. Basic amenities include charging points, drinking water, and restroom access. The AC waiting room offers more comfortable seating and cleaner facilities.

### Left Luggage Facilities

The cloak room operates on the ground floor near platform 1, open 24 hours daily. Rates are ₹30 ($0.36) per bag for the first 24 hours, then ₹15 ($0.18) for each additional 12-hour period.

You can store bags for up to 30 days, though most tourists use the service for same-day storage while exploring the city. The facility accepts bags of all sizes and provides secure storage with proper tagging systems.

### Other Amenities

The station has multiple food courts and vendors selling snacks, meals, and beverages. ATMs from major banks operate on the ground floor, and several mobile recharge and internet booths serve passengers.

Clean restrooms are available on all platforms, with paid premium washrooms (₹5-10 or $0.06-0.12) offering better maintenance. Medical facilities include a first aid room staffed during daytime hours.

## Platform Guidance and Tips

Platforms 1-3 primarily handle long-distance express trains, while platforms 4-6 serve passenger and mail trains. Electronic display boards show train numbers, arrival/departure times, and platform assignments in Hindi and English.

Arrive at the station 30 minutes before departure for express trains and 15 minutes for local services. During festival seasons, allow extra time for security checks and platform access.

The foot overbridge provides the quickest access between platforms, while the subway stays less crowded. Platform vendors sell water, snacks, and magazines, but prices are higher than outside shops.

For [first-time visitors](jaipur-travel-tips-first-time/), familiarize yourself with your coach position using the train composition chart displayed on each platform. This saves time finding your seat after boarding.
