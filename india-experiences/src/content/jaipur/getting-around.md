Jaipur is spread out — the old walled city is walkable, but forts and palaces require transport. Here's how to get around.

---

## Airport to City

### Jaipur International Airport (JAI)

Located 13 km from the city centre. No metro or bus connection.

### Prepaid Taxi

**Where:** Counter inside arrivals hall

Pay at counter, get receipt, give to driver at destination. Fixed rates, no haggling.

### Uber/Ola

**Cost:** ₹300-500 to central Jaipur
**Time:** 30-45 minutes

You'll need an Indian SIM for OTP verification. Get one at airport counters before booking.

### Hotel Pickup

**Cost:** ₹100-200 to most destinations

## Getting Around the City

### Auto Rickshaws

The default transport for short trips. Green-and-yellow three-wheelers everywhere.

**How it works:**
1. Flag down an auto
2. State your destination
3. Negotiate price BEFORE getting in
4. Pay at the end

**Approximate fares:**
| Route | Fair Price |
|-------|------------|
| Within old city | ₹50-100 |
| Old city to Amber Fort | ₹200-300 |
| Old city to Nahargarh | ₹150-250 |
| Station to MI Road | ₹80-120 |

**Tips:**
- Fares are negotiable — start at 50% of first quote
- Carry small notes (₹10, ₹20, ₹50)
- Autos at tourist spots charge more — walk away and find another
- Shared autos run fixed routes for ₹10-20

### Uber and Ola

**Advantages:**
- Fixed prices (no negotiating)
- Air-conditioned cars
- GPS tracking
- Card payment option

**Typical fares:**
- Within city: ₹100-200
- To Amber Fort: ₹200-350
- Full-day rental: ₹2,000-3,000

**Uber Auto:** Books you an auto at fixed app price. Best of both worlds.

### Hiring a Car with Driver

For full-day sightseeing covering multiple forts.

**Cost:** ₹1,500-2,500 for 8 hours/80 km
**Book through:** Hotel, tour agency, or apps like Savaari

**Recommended when:**
- Visiting Amber, Jaigarh, and Nahargarh in one day
- Travelling with family or group
- Want commentary (drivers often know history)

### Walking

The walled old city is walkable:
- Hawa Mahal to City Palace: 5 minutes
- City Palace to Jantar Mantar: 2 minutes
- Tripolia Bazaar to Johari Bazaar: 10 minutes

Watch for traffic — pedestrians don't have right of way.

### City Buses

Cheap (₹10-30) but confusing. No English signage. Crowded. Not recommended for tourists unless you speak Hindi and enjoy adventure.

### Cycle Rickshaws

Available in old city for very short distances. Slow, cheap (₹20-50), atmospheric. Good for Bazaar exploration when you're tired.

## Transport Between Key Sights

### Old City (Walled City)

Everything walkable:
- Hawa Mahal
- City Palace
- Jantar Mantar
- Albert Hall Museum
- All major bazaars

### To Amber Fort

**Distance:** 11 km from old city
**Auto:** ₹200-300 one way
**Uber:** ₹200-350 one way
**Return options:** Arrange return with same driver or book new ride

**Tip:** Combine with Jaigarh Fort (same hilltop, shared ticket) and Nahargarh on the way back.

### To Nahargarh Fort

**Distance:** 6 km from old city (uphill)
**Auto:** ₹150-250 one way
**Best time:** Sunset — stunning city views

**The scenic route:** Some visitors trek up via Jaipur's western hills. Allow 1-2 hours. Not recommended in summer heat.

### Three Forts in One Day

The efficient route:
1. Start at **Amber Fort** (morning, 2-3 hours)
2. Continue to **Jaigarh Fort** (30 minutes)
3. Drive to **Nahargarh Fort** (sunset)
4. Return to old city

Hiring a car with driver (₹1,500-2,500) makes this comfortable and efficient.

## Practical Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Download Uber/Ola before arriving** — you'll need them
