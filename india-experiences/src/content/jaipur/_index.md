Jaipur is India's Pink City — a planned 18th-century capital built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II with wide boulevards, geometric grids, and buildings painted in the distinctive terracotta pink that defines the city today. UNESCO recognized the walled city as a World Heritage Site in 2019, and for good reason: this is one of the world's best-preserved examples of pre-modern urban planning, wrapped in Rajput grandeur.

The city anchors India's Golden Triangle alongside Delhi and Agra, but Jaipur deserves more than a rushed day trip between the two. The forts alone — Amber, Nahargarh, Jaigarh — could fill two days. Add the bazaars, the food, the craft workshops, and you're looking at 3-4 days minimum.

This guide covers the best things to do in Jaipur in 2026, with current prices, transport options, and a suggested 3-day itinerary. Use it as your starting point, then explore the category guides for deeper coverage.

## The Big Three Forts

Jaipur's three hilltop forts form a connected ridge along the Aravalli hills north of the city. You can see all three from certain vantage points, and together they tell the story of Rajput military and architectural power.

[Amber Fort](/jaipur/amber-fort-jaipur-guide/) is the showpiece — a massive palace complex 11km from the city center, built from pale yellow and pink sandstone. The Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), Ganesh Pol gate, and the private apartments of the maharajas are worth the ₹500 foreign tourist entry fee (₹100 for Indians). Get there by 8:30am to beat the tour groups. The elephant rides up to the fort are controversial and increasingly avoided; walk or take a jeep (₹300 return) instead.

[Nahargarh Fort](/jaipur/nahargarh-fort-jaipur/) perches directly above the city, offering the best sunset views of Jaipur's pink skyline. Entry is ₹200 (₹50 Indians). The Madhavendra Bhawan inside has twelve identical suites built for the king's twelve queens — connected by corridors so he could visit each without the others knowing. There's a cafe at the top with cold beer and decent food.

[Jaigarh Fort](/jaipur/jaigarh-fort-jaipur/) connects to Amber Fort via an underground passage and houses the world's largest cannon on wheels — Jaivana, which was never fired in battle. Entry is ₹150 (₹35 Indians). Jaigarh is the least crowded of the three and offers fantastic views of Amber below.

A combined ticket for all three forts costs ₹1,000 for foreigners, valid for two days. This saves money if you're doing them all.

## The Walled City

The Old City is Jaipur's UNESCO-listed core — a 4.5-square-kilometer grid of pink buildings, wide streets, and seven gates. This is where you'll find the City Palace, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, and the main bazaars.

[City Palace](/jaipur/city-palace-jaipur-guide/) still houses the royal family in one wing. The public sections include the Mubarak Mahal (textiles museum), the Armoury, and the stunning Peacock Gate with its mosaic peacocks. Entry is ₹500 (₹75 Indians) for the main palace, or ₹2,500 ($30) for the royal apartments tour. Allow 2-3 hours.

[Hawa Mahal](/jaipur/hawa-mahal-jaipur-guide/) — the Palace of Winds — is Jaipur's most photographed building. Its 953 small windows allowed royal women to observe street life without being seen. Entry is only ₹200 (₹50 Indians), but the best photos are from across the street. Come early morning or late afternoon for the best light on the pink facade.

[Jantar Mantar](/jaipur/jantar-mantar-jaipur-guide/) is the largest of five observatories built by Sawai Jai Singh II, and the only one still used for astronomical calculations. The giant sundial is accurate to two seconds. Entry is ₹200 (₹50 Indians). A guide is worth ₹200-300 — without explanation, the instruments look like abstract sculptures.

## Food & Drink

Rajasthani cuisine is built for the desert: preserved, spiced, and rich. Dal baati churma is the signature — baked wheat balls served with lentils and sweet crushed wheat. Laal maas (red meat curry) is fiery with Mathania chillies. Ghewar is the sweet you'll see everywhere, a honeycomb-like disc soaked in sugar syrup.

Our [Jaipur food guide](/jaipur/food/) covers the best restaurants, street food spots, and food tours. Start with [Jaipur's street food](/jaipur/best-street-food-jaipur/) — the kachoris at Rawat Mishthan Bhandar (₹30 each), the lassi at Lassiwala on MI Road (₹40 for a clay cup), and the pyaaz kachori at Samrat restaurant.

[Cooking classes](/jaipur/cooking-classes-jaipur/) are excellent here. You'll learn to make dal baati churma, gatte ki sabzi, and ker sangri in a home kitchen. Classes run ₹2,000-4,000 ($25-50) for 3-4 hours including market visit and meal.

For restaurants, LMB (Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar) in Johari Bazaar has been serving Rajasthani thalis since 1954. Suvarna Mahal at Rambagh Palace is the splurge option — Rajput cuisine in a former maharaja's dining room, ₹5,000+ per head.

## Markets & Shopping

Jaipur is a craft city. Gem cutting, block printing, blue pottery, lac jewelry, leather juttis — artisans have been perfecting these trades for centuries. The bazaars sell direct to you at prices that make tourist markups elsewhere look absurd.

[Johari Bazaar](/jaipur/johari-bazaar-jaipur-shopping/) is gem and jewelry central. Jaipur processes 90% of India's cut gemstones, and this is where dealers sell to the public. Know your stones or bring someone who does — this is not a market for beginners.

[Bapu Bazaar](/jaipur/bapu-bazaar-jaipur-textiles/) is textiles: block-printed fabrics, bandhani (tie-dye), cotton quilts, and ready-made clothes. Prices are genuinely low — cotton kurtas from ₹200-500 ($2.50-6).

[Nehru Bazaar](/jaipur/nehru-bazaar-jaipur-handicrafts/) sells juttis (embroidered leather shoes) for ₹300-1,000 ($4-12), puppets, and handicrafts. This is souvenir central.

[Tripolia Bazaar](/jaipur/tripolia-bazaar-jaipur/) is for lac bangles and household items — less touristy, more local.

The [markets guide](/jaipur/markets/) has a full breakdown. Bargaining is expected everywhere except fixed-price government emporiums. Start at 40% of asking price.

## Cultural Experiences

Beyond forts and food, Jaipur offers craft workshops and cultural experiences that give you hands-on access to Rajasthani traditions.

[Block printing workshops](/jaipur/best-art-workshops-jaipur/) let you carve your own wooden block and print fabric. Half-day sessions run ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36). Anokhi Museum of Hand Printing in Amber is the most professional setup.

[Blue pottery classes](/jaipur/best-art-workshops-jaipur/) teach the Persian-influenced craft that Jaipur revived in the 1950s. Kripal Kumbh in the artisan colony is the best-known workshop.

[Folk dance shows](/jaipur/folk-dance-shows-jaipur/) happen nightly at Chokhi Dhani (₹1,100 entry includes dinner and entertainment) and several heritage hotels. These are touristy but fun — fire dancing, puppetry, and Kalbelia snake-charmer dances.

## Day Trips

Jaipur is a base for several excellent day trips.

[Pushkar](/jaipur/pushkar-day-trip-jaipur/) is 150km west — a holy lake surrounded by 52 ghats and 400+ temples. The annual camel fair (November) is famous, but Pushkar is worth visiting year-round. Expect 3 hours each way by road.

[Ranthambore National Park](/jaipur/ranthambore-day-trip-jaipur/) is 180km east, one of India's best places to see tigers. Day trips are possible but exhausting — better to stay overnight. Safari permits are ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) plus vehicle fees.

Abhaneri stepwell (85km) and Bhangarh fort (90km) make a combined day trip — the stepwell is stunning, the fort is "haunted" and closed after sunset.

## Getting Around

Jaipur is more manageable than Delhi but still requires planning.

**Auto-rickshaws** are everywhere. Always agree on a price before getting in — expect ₹150-300 for trips within the walled city, ₹300-500 to Amber Fort. Use Uber/Ola to benchmark fair prices.

**Uber and Ola** work well and are the easiest option. A ride across the city costs ₹150-250.

**Jaipur Metro** has two lines, but they don't cover the main tourist areas. Useful for getting to some bazaars but not essential.

**Cycle rickshaws** are available in the Old City for short hops. Bargain hard — ₹30-50 for short distances.

**Day car hire** with driver runs ₹2,500-3,500 ($30-42) for 8 hours/80km. This is the best option for seeing Amber, Nahargarh, and Jaigarh in one day.
