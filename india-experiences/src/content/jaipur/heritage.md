The fort's architecture combines Hindu and Mughal styles, with four main courtyards connected by gates and walkways. The Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) features thousands of tiny mirrors that create a starry effect when illuminated. The Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) showcases intricate lattice work and painted walls depicting hunting scenes and floral motifs.

The fort offers spectacular views of Maota Lake and the Aravalli Hills. Plan 2-3 hours for a complete visit, including the palace complex, gardens, and ramparts.

## City Palace Complex

The City Palace occupies the heart of Jaipur's old city, covering one-seventh of the walled area. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II began construction in 1729, and successive rulers added sections until the 20th century. The royal family still resides in part of the complex.

The palace combines Rajasthani, Mughal, and European architectural elements. The Chandra Mahal (Moon Palace) serves as the current royal residence, while the Mubarak Mahal (Welcome Palace) houses the textile and costume museum. The Diwan-i-Khas features two massive silver vessels that hold Guinness World Records as the largest silver objects ever made.

## Nahargarh Fort

Nahargarh Fort crowns the Aravalli Hills north of Jaipur, built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II as part of the city's defense ring. The fort's name means "abode of tigers," though it primarily served as a retreat and hunting lodge for the royal family.

The Madhavendra Bhawan palace complex within the fort features identical suites built for the king's nine queens. Each suite includes bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and lobbies connected by corridors. The central suite housed the king during visits.

**Entry Details:**
- Entry fee: ₹300 ($3.75) for foreigners, ₹50 for Indians

## Heritage Architecture Styles

Jaipur's heritage sites showcase three distinct architectural influences that evolved over 300 years of Rajput rule.

**Rajasthani Style**: Characterized by intricate stone carving, jharokhas (overhanging enclosed balconies), chhatris (elevated dome-shaped pavilions), and red sandstone construction. Best examples include Hawa Mahal and outer walls of Amber Fort.

**Mughal Influence**: Features geometric patterns, marble inlay work, symmetrical gardens, and Islamic architectural elements. Visible in Amber Fort's Sheesh Mahal and City Palace's Diwan-i-Aam.

**European Elements**: Added during the 19th century, including clock towers, European-style furniture, and Victorian decorative elements. Found in later additions to City Palace and some sections of Nahargarh Fort.

For more context on [what Jaipur is famous for](/jaipur/what-is-jaipur-famous-for/), these architectural styles represent the cultural synthesis that makes the Pink City unique among Indian destinations.

## Best Times to Visit

Heritage sites operate year-round, but timing affects your experience significantly. October through March offers pleasant weather for extensive exploration, while summer months (April-June) require early morning or late afternoon visits.

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- **Winter (Oct-Mar)**: Ideal weather, crowds peak December-January
- **Summer (Apr-Jun)**: Intense heat, visit early morning or evening only
- **Monsoon (Jul-Sep)**: Occasional closures, fewer crowds, lush surroundings

Early morning visits (8-10 AM) provide cooler temperatures, better lighting for photography, and smaller crowds. Most heritage sites open by 9:00 AM, with Amber Fort accessible from 8:00 AM.

When planning [how many days you need in Jaipur](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/), dedicate at least 2 full days to properly explore the major heritage sites without rushing.
