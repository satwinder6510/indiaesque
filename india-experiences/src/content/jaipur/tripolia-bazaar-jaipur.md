**Tripolia Bazaar is Jaipur's premier destination for iron and brass shopping, specializing in traditional Rajasthani metalwork, decorative items ranging ₹200-5000 ($2.50-60), and custom orders with 15-day delivery.**

Located near the City Palace, this centuries-old market has served as the royal metalworkers' hub since the 18th century. Today, you'll find over 200 shops selling everything from intricate brass figurines to heavy-duty iron cookware.

## What You'll Find at Tripolia Bazaar

The market divides into distinct sections based on metalwork specialties. The brass section dominates the eastern side, while iron workers occupy the western portion near Tripolia Gate.

**Traditional Utensils**: Brass thalis (₹800-2500 or $10-30), water vessels (₹400-1500 or $5-18), and ceremonial items form the core inventory. Many pieces feature hand-engraved designs passed down through generations.

**Decorative Items**: Wall hangings, religious figurines, and ornamental bowls range ₹200-3000 ($2.50-36). Large statement pieces like brass elephants or traditional lamps cost ₹2000-5000 ($25-60).

**Lac Bangles**: Several shops specialize in traditional lac bangles with brass work, priced ₹50-300 ($0.60-3.60) per set. These make excellent gifts and showcase local craftsmanship.

## Wholesale Opportunities

Tripolia Bazaar caters extensively to wholesale buyers. Most established shops offer 20-30% discounts on orders above ₹10,000 ($120). The Agarwal Brothers shop and Sharma Handicrafts provide export-quality packaging and documentation.

For serious wholesale buyers, visit during weekday mornings when artisans demonstrate live metalwork techniques. You can negotiate better rates and understand production timelines firsthand.

## Custom Orders and Metalwork Demonstrations

The bazaar's strength lies in custom metalwork capabilities. Experienced artisans can replicate designs from photographs or create pieces based on your specifications. Standard delivery time is 15 days, though simple modifications take 3-5 days.

Watch master craftsmen demonstrate traditional techniques like repoussé (hammering designs from the reverse side) and chasing (refining details from the front). These demonstrations happen daily between 2-4 PM at select workshops.

**Ram Singh & Sons** and **Traditional Metalworks** offer the best custom services. Both require 50% advance payment and provide progress updates via WhatsApp.

## Shopping Tips and Bargaining

Start your negotiations at 40-50% of the quoted price for retail purchases. Wholesale rates require less aggressive bargaining but expect 15-25% reductions from initial quotes.

Check brass items for thickness - quality pieces feel substantial and show even coloring. Avoid items with visible welding marks or uneven surfaces. For iron products, ensure proper seasoning and rust-free finishes.

Payment methods include cash (preferred for better rates), UPI, and cards at larger establishments. Many shops provide shipping services to major Indian cities for ₹200-500 ($2.50-6) depending on weight.

## Getting There and Best Visit Times

Tripolia Bazaar sits 1.5 km from Jaipur Railway Station and connects easily via auto-rickshaw (₹40-60 or $0.50-0.75). If you're planning your [Jaipur itinerary](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/), allocate 2-3 hours for thorough browsing.

The market operates 10 AM-8 PM daily except Sundays when many shops close early. Visit between 10 AM-12 PM or 4 PM-7 PM when natural lighting helps evaluate metalwork quality properly.

For first-time visitors, combining Tripolia Bazaar with nearby City Palace creates an efficient shopping and sightseeing day. Check our [Jaipur travel tips](/jaipur/jaipur-travel-tips-first-time/) for navigating the old city area safely and efficiently.
