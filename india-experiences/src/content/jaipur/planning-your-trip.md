## Best Time to Visit

### October to March: Peak Season

This is when Jaipur is at its best. Cool weather makes fort climbing comfortable.

**October-November:** Ideal. 20-30°C, clear skies, Diwali festivities. Crowds building.

**December-February:** Cold mornings (8-15°C), perfect afternoons. Peak tourist season — book hotels ahead.

**March:** Warming up (25-35°C). Still good. Holi celebrations. Last comfortable month.

### April to June: Avoid

Temperatures hit 40-45°C daily. Forts become unbearable by 10 AM. Heat waves are common. Only visit if you have no choice.

### July to September: Monsoon

Mixed experience. Fewer tourists, green landscapes, dramatic skies. But:
- Humidity is high
- Some attractions flood or close
- Outdoor activities limited by rain

**Best monsoon month:** September — rain easing, crowds still low.
