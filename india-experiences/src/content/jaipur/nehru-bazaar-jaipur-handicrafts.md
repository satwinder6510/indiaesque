**Nehru Bazaar specializes in authentic Rajasthani handicrafts including blue pottery (₹100-2000), lac jewelry, handwoven carpets, and antiques. Located near Hawa Mahal, the market offers workshop visits, export packaging services (₹500-1500), and government quality certificates for genuine handicrafts.**

Nehru Bazaar sits in the heart of Jaipur's walled city, just 200 meters from Hawa Mahal on Sireh Deori Road. This 150-year-old market houses over 80 shops specializing in traditional Rajasthani handicrafts, making it your best bet for authentic souvenirs and gifts.

## Blue Pottery — Jaipur's Signature Craft

Blue pottery remains Nehru Bazaar's star attraction. Authentic pieces range from ₹100 for small decorative items to ₹2000 ($24) for large vases and serving platters. Look for the characteristic cobalt blue and white patterns on a translucent base.

**Authentic blue pottery shops:**
- Maharaja Blue Pottery (Shop 23) — Family-run for 4 generations
- Jaipur Blue Art Palace (Shop 67) — Government-certified artisan cooperative
- Royal Ceramics (Shop 45) — Offers live pottery demonstrations

Real blue pottery feels lighter than regular ceramics and has slight variations in brush strokes. Machine-made imitations appear too perfect and weigh more. Ask shopkeepers for quality certificates issued by the Rajasthan State Handicrafts Development Corporation.

## Lac Jewelry and Bangles

Lac jewelry prices start at ₹50 for simple bangles and reach ₹500 ($6) for elaborate necklace sets. The best lac work comes from Jaipur's Maniharon ka Rasta, but Nehru Bazaar offers competitive prices with better English-speaking vendors.

**Quality indicators for lac jewelry:**
- Smooth finish without visible cracks
- Vibrant colors that don't rub off on your fingers
- Proper setting of mirrors and stones
- Lightweight feel

Chunni Lal Lac Works (Shop 12) and Rajasthani Lac Palace (Shop 78) maintain the highest quality standards and offer custom designs within 24 hours.

## Handwoven Carpets and Durries

Carpet prices vary dramatically based on knot count, materials, and size. Cotton durries start at ₹2000 ($24) for 4x6 feet, while silk carpets reach ₹15000 ($180) for similar dimensions.

**Carpet buying tips:**
- Check knot density — authentic pieces have 120-400 knots per square inch
- Look for natural dyes that create subtle color variations
- Examine the back — handwoven carpets show irregular patterns
- Ask about origin — Jaipur, Mirzapur, and Kashmir produce distinct styles

Carpet Palace (Shop 34) and Heritage Weavers (Shop 89) offer the largest selections and provide authenticity certificates. Both shops arrange export packaging and shipping worldwide.

## Antiques and Brass Work

Nehru Bazaar's antique section concentrates in shops 15-30. Genuine antiques require Archaeological Survey of India permits for export, but quality reproductions offer similar aesthetic appeal at ₹500-5000 ($6-60).

Popular brass items include:
- Decorative plates and trays (₹300-800)
- Oil lamps and diyas (₹150-400)
- Figurines and sculptures (₹500-2500)
- Jewelry boxes (₹400-1200)

## Workshop Visits and Artisan Interactions

Several shops arrange visits to nearby artisan workshops. Blue Pottery Art Centre (behind Shop 23) runs free 30-minute demonstrations daily at 11 AM, 2 PM, and 4 PM. You'll watch craftsmen shape clay, apply glazes, and paint traditional patterns.

Lac bangle making workshops operate in Maniharon ka Rasta, just 10 minutes' walk from Nehru Bazaar. Rajesh Lac Works offers 45-minute sessions for ₹200 ($2.40) per person, including materials to make your own bangles.

## Export Packaging and Shipping Services

Most established shops provide professional export packaging. Services include:
- Bubble wrap and wooden crate packaging (₹500-800)
- Customs declaration forms and invoices
- Door-to-door shipping via DHL, FedEx, or Blue Dart
- Insurance coverage up to $500 per package
- Tracking numbers and delivery confirmation

Shipping costs depend on weight and destination:
- USA/Europe: ₹1200-2000 ($14-24) for 5kg package
- Australia/Japan: ₹1500-2500 ($18-30) for 5kg package
- UAE/Singapore: ₹800-1200 ($10-14) for 5kg package

## Quality Certification and Authenticity

Government-certified shops display Handicrafts Mark certificates from the Office of Development Commissioner for Handicrafts. These shops guarantee:
- Authentic handmade products
- Fair pricing without exploitation of artisans
- Quality materials and traditional techniques
- Proper export documentation

Look for the "India Handloom" and "Handicrafts Mark" logos on shop windows and product tags.

## Price Comparison with Other Markets

Nehru Bazaar prices typically run 20-30% higher than Johari Bazaar but offer better English communication and export services. Bapu Bazaar charges similar rates but stocks fewer authentic pieces.

**Sample price comparisons:**
- Blue pottery vase (8 inches): Nehru Bazaar ₹600, Johari Bazaar ₹450
- Lac bangle set (12 pieces): Nehru Bazaar ₹200, Bapu Bazaar ₹180
- Cotton durrie (4x6 feet): Nehru Bazaar ₹2200, Johari Bazaar ₹1800

The extra cost covers better packaging, authenticity guarantees, and hassle-free export services.

## Best Shopping Strategy

Visit Nehru Bazaar after 10 AM when all shops open. Spend your first hour browsing without buying to understand quality differences and price ranges. Return to shops that impressed you for serious negotiations.

Most vendors expect bargaining but quality-certified items have fixed prices. Cash payments get 5-10% discounts, while credit cards add 3% processing fees.

Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours if you want to explore workshops and compare prices across multiple shops. The market gets crowded between 2-5 PM, so early morning or evening visits offer more personal attention.

When planning your [Jaipur itinerary](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/), allocate half a day for Nehru Bazaar shopping combined with nearby [Hawa Mahal and City Palace visits](/jaipur/). The market connects easily to other [major attractions](/jaipur/what-is-jaipur-famous-for/) via auto-rickshaw or taxi.
