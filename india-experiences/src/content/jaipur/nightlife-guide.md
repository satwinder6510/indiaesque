faq:
  - question: "What is the nightlife like in Jaipur?"
    answer: "Jaipur's nightlife is more relaxed than Delhi or Mumbai. Rooftop bars with fort views are the highlight. Most venues close by midnight. The scene centers around C-Scheme, MI Road, and heritage hotels. Don't expect wild clubbing — it's drinks with views."
  - question: "What are the best rooftop bars in Jaipur?"
    answer: "Top picks: Tapri (multiple locations, tea bar with views), Bar Palladio (Italian, gorgeous setting), The Forresta (cocktails, greenery), 100 Quarters (craft cocktails), and Nahargarh Fort's cafe for sunset drinks."
  - question: "Are there nightclubs in Jaipur?"
    answer: "A few, but the scene is limited. Blackout, Grunge, and hotel clubs exist but aren't destinations. Jaipur is better for rooftop lounges and bar-restaurants than dance clubs. For serious clubbing, Delhi or Mumbai are better."

Jaipur isn't a party city — but that's not why you're here. Instead, enjoy rooftop drinks with fort views, heritage hotel atmospheres, and relaxed evenings. Here's where to go after dark.

---

## The Scene

Jaipur nightlife peaks at lounges and rooftop bars, not clubs. Most venues close by midnight (1 AM on weekends). The crowd is mixed — tourists, expats, local professionals.

**Best areas:**
- C-Scheme (bars and restaurants)
- MI Road (cafes, some bars)
- Heritage hotel bars

**Legal drinking age:** 25 in Rajasthan

## Heritage Hotel Bars

The grand hotels have atmospheric bars worth visiting even if you're not staying.

### Steam (Rambagh Palace)

Former billiard room of the Maharaja. Old-world elegance, expensive drinks.

### Polo Bar (Rambagh Palace)

Colonial-style bar with polo memorabilia. Classic cocktails.

Hunting lodge atmosphere. More accessible pricing than Rambagh.

## Clubs

Limited options compared to larger cities.

**Blackout** (Clarks Amer Hotel)
Jaipur's most established club. Bollywood and commercial music. ₹1,500-2,000 cover.

**Grunge**
Younger crowd. DJ nights on weekends.

**Hotel clubs:**
Various 5-stars have club nights, usually weekends only.

**Reality check:** Jaipur isn't a club destination. If clubbing is important, save it for Delhi.

## Things to Do at Night

### Cultural

**Chokhi Dhani** (until 11 PM)
Full evening of folk performances, food, village atmosphere.

Watch a Bollywood film in this art deco palace of a cinema. The interval is an experience.

Drive up for sunset, stay for early evening views.

**Jal Mahal**
The water palace is lit at night. No entry, but beautiful from the shore.

**Albert Hall Museum**
Illuminated exterior — worth a night photo.

### Eating Late

Most restaurants serve until 10-10:30 PM. Options:
- Bar Palladio
- The Forresta

- Some MI Road spots

### Walking

MI Road after dinner is pleasant — shops closing, crowds thinning, street food wrapping up.

## Tips

1. **Reserve for Bar Palladio** — Gets busy on weekends
2. **Sunset at Nahargarh** — Arrive by 5 PM
3. **Dress up slightly** — Jaipur is conservative
4. **Don't expect Delhi/Mumbai energy** — Embrace the relaxed pace
5. **Uber home** — Don't drink and drive, autos unreliable late
