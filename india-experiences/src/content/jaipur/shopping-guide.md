## What to Buy

### Block-Printed Textiles

Jaipur is India's block-printing capital. Traditional patterns printed by hand using carved wooden blocks.

**What to look for:**
- Bedsheets and quilts
- Scarves and dupattas
- Dress fabric by metre

- **Bapu Bazaar** — Cheaper, bargain needed, quality varies
- **Sanganer** — The printing village, 16 km from city, wholesale

**How to check quality:** Look for slight imperfections — that's hand printing. Machine prints are too perfect.

## Bargaining Tips

### Where to Bargain

**Yes:** All old city bazaars, Bapu Bazaar, street vendors

**No:** Anokhi, Fabindia, government emporiums, malls

### How to Bargain

1. **Browse first** — Know what you want, compare shops
2. **Ask the price** — Vendor quotes high
3. **Show mild interest** — Don't seem desperate
4. **Counter at 40-50%** — Lower than you'll pay
5. **Negotiate up slowly** — Meet in middle (60-70% of first price)
6. **Walk away** — Often triggers best price
7. **Stay friendly** — It's a game, not a fight

### Sample Negotiations

| Item | First Quote | Fair Price |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Block-print scarf | ₹800 | ₹350-450 |
| Silver earrings | ₹1,200 | ₹600-800 |
| Juttis | ₹1,500 | ₹600-900 |
| Lac bangles (set) | ₹300 | ₹150-200 |

## Shopping by Area

### Old City (Walled City)

All the bazaars are here. Walkable but chaotic. Best for traditional goods.

### MI Road

Government emporium, Niros, established shops. More comfortable shopping experience.

### C-Scheme / Civil Lines

Modern shops, boutiques, Anokhi, galleries. Air-conditioned options.

### Sanganer (16 km)

Block-printing village. Wholesale prices, watch artisans work. Worth a half-day trip.

## Scams to Avoid

### Gem Resale Scam

Someone offers gems at "wholesale" to resell at home. The gems are worthless or vastly overpriced. Never buy gems for "investment."

### Commission Shops

Auto drivers take you to shops where they earn commission. Prices are 30-50% higher. Choose your own destinations.

### Fake Antiques

Most "antiques" are reproductions. Don't pay antique prices unless you're an expert.

### Switched Items

Confirm the exact item being wrapped matches what you selected. Some shops switch quality.

## Practical Tips

**Best time:** Morning (10 AM - 1 PM) or evening (5-8 PM). Midday is hot.

**Closed:** Most bazaars close Sundays. Timing varies by area.

**Payment:** Cash preferred in bazaars. UPI accepted at many shops. Cards at established stores.

**Shipping:** Many shops ship internationally. Get proper documentation for customs.

**Carry:** Small notes (₹10, ₹20, ₹50) for easier bargaining.
