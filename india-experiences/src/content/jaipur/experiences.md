Jaipur offers experiences beyond the famous forts and palaces — from floating over Amber Fort at sunrise to learning centuries-old block printing techniques. The city's craft heritage, royal history, and desert setting create opportunities you won't find elsewhere.

This guide covers Jaipur's best experiences beyond standard sightseeing. For monument visits and practical information, see the [Jaipur city guide](/jaipur/).
