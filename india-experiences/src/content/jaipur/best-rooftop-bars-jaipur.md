## Heritage Hotel Terraces - Amber Fort Views and Royal Ambiance

The real magic begins after 7 PM when Amber Fort's illumination creates a golden backdrop. This timing coincides perfectly with dinner service at most heritage hotels.

When planning your [visit to Jaipur](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/), dedicate at least one evening to rooftop dining for spectacular sunset and fort views.

## Timing Your Rooftop Bar Experience

Sunset occurs between 6-7 PM depending on the season, making this the prime time for rooftop visits. Most venues open their terraces at 5 PM, giving you time to settle in before the golden hour begins.

Fort illumination starts precisely at 7 PM and continues until 10 PM, creating the perfect backdrop for evening drinks. Plan to arrive by 6 PM for sunset views, then stay for the illuminated fort spectacle.

Weekend evenings (Friday-Sunday) require advance reservations at all popular spots. Weekday visits offer more flexibility but sunset timing tables fill up regardless of the day.

## Food Options and Dining Packages

Most rooftop bars serve full meals alongside their drink menus. PCO offers Continental cuisine, while Tattoo Café specializes in fusion dishes. Heritage hotel terraces focus on traditional Rajasthani cuisine.

Appetizers range ₹250-450 ($3-5), main courses cost ₹400-800 ($5-10), and desserts start at ₹200 ($2.50). Many venues offer combo deals pairing drinks with appetizers for ₹800-1200 ($10-14).

Special dinner packages at heritage hotels include multiple courses with welcome drinks. These fixed menus cost ₹1200-1800 ($14-22) per person and provide excellent value for the royal dining experience.
