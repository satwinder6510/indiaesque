City Palace stands at the heart of Jaipur's old city, covering one-seventh of the walled city area. Built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II starting in 1729, this palace complex combines Rajput, Mughal, and European architectural styles. The current royal family still lives in parts of the palace, making it a living heritage site.

## Palace Layout and Main Attractions

### Mubarak Mahal (Welcome Palace)

Mubarak Mahal serves as the first major structure you'll encounter after entering through Udai Pol gate. Built in the late 19th century, this three-story palace now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum. The museum displays royal costumes, including the massive outfit of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I, who stood 7 feet tall and weighed 250 kg.

The textile collection includes silk sarees, embroidered shawls, and ceremonial robes spanning three centuries. Photography is allowed in most sections, but avoid using flash near delicate fabrics.

### Chandra Mahal (Moon Palace)

Chandra Mahal is the seven-story main residence where the royal family currently lives. Only the ground floor and first floor are open to public visits. The ground floor houses the Sukh Niwas (Hall of Pleasure) with intricate mirror work and miniature paintings.

The first floor features the Chavi Niwas, displaying blue pottery, miniature paintings, and manuscripts. The upper floors remain private royal quarters, giving you a glimpse into living royal heritage.

### Pritam Niwas Chowk

This courtyard features four stunning gates representing the four seasons:
- **Peacock Gate (Mor Gate)**: Dedicated to autumn with intricate peacock designs
- **Lotus Gate (Kamal Gate)**: Represents summer with lotus motifs  
- **Green Gate (Leheriya Gate)**: Symbolizes spring with floral patterns
- **Rose Gate (Gulabi Gate)**: Depicts winter with rose designs

Each gate leads to different palace sections and offers excellent photo opportunities.

## Museums and Collections

### Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience)

Now converted into an art gallery, this hall showcases miniature paintings, manuscripts, and carpets. The collection includes works from different Rajasthani schools of painting and Mughal miniatures.
