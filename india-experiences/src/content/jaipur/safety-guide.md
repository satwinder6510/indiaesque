faq:
  - question: "Is Jaipur safe for tourists?"
    answer: "Yes. Jaipur is one of India's safest tourist cities. The main concerns are touts, overcharging, and gem shop scams — not violent crime. Use common sense: stick to busy areas at night, use app-based transport, and ignore unsolicited help."
  - question: "Is Jaipur safe for solo female travellers?"
    answer: "Generally yes, with precautions. Dress modestly, use Uber/Ola at night, avoid isolated areas after dark, and trust your instincts. Many solo women visit Jaipur without issues. Heritage hotels and tourist areas are comfortable."
  - question: "What scams should I watch for in Jaipur?"
    answer: "The big ones: gem shop scams (don't buy gems for 'resale'), tour guide commission traps, auto drivers taking you to their 'uncle's shop', and inflated prices at tourist spots. Ignore unsolicited help and book through apps or hotels."

Jaipur is a safe city for tourists. The risks are financial (scams, overcharging) rather than physical. Here's what to watch for.

---

## Overall Safety

Jaipur is one of India's most tourist-friendly cities. Violent crime against tourists is rare. The main challenges:
- Persistent touts and salespeople
- Overcharging at tourist spots
- Gem and carpet scams
- Traffic chaos

Most visitors have trouble-free trips. Basic precautions are enough.

## Common Scams

### The Gem Shop Scam

**How it works:** Someone befriends you, takes you to a gem shop, and pressures you to buy stones at "wholesale prices" to resell at home for profit. The gems are worthless or vastly overpriced.

**Reality:** No tourist has ever profited from this. The gems are either fake or worth a fraction of what you pay.

**Prevention:** Never buy gems for "investment." If someone steers you toward a shop, walk away.

### Commission Traps

**How it works:** Auto drivers, guides, and friendly strangers take you to specific shops where they earn commission. Prices are inflated 30-50% to cover the kickback.

**Signs:**
- Driver suggests a "better" shop than the one you named
- New friend offers to show you their "family's business"
- Guide has strong opinions about where to eat/shop

**Prevention:** Choose your own destinations. If a driver takes you somewhere you didn't ask, refuse to enter.

### Auto Rickshaw Overcharging

**How it works:** Drivers at tourist spots quote ₹300-500 for ₹50-100 rides.

**Prevention:**
- Use Uber/Ola for fixed prices
- Agree on fare BEFORE getting in
- Know approximate distances (old city to Amber Fort: 11 km)
- Walk away from autos parked at monuments

### "Official" Tour Guides

**How it works:** Unlicensed guides attach themselves at monuments and demand payment after.

**Prevention:**
- Say "no thank you" firmly
- If you want a guide, hire through your hotel or the official ticket counter
- Licensed guides have ID cards

### Ticket Touts

**How it works:** At popular sites, people offer to "skip the line" or sell tickets at higher prices.

**Prevention:** Buy tickets only at official counters or online (Rajasthan Tourism website).

## Solo Female Travel

### Is It Safe?

Yes, with standard precautions. Many solo women visit Jaipur comfortably. The city is used to tourists and generally respectful.

### Recommendations

**Dress:**
- Cover shoulders and knees (cultural and practical)
- Loose-fitting clothes are more comfortable anyway
- Avoid clothing that draws excessive attention

**Transport:**
- Use Uber/Ola, especially at night
- Share your ride details with someone
- Sit in the back seat
- Avoid empty autos late at night

**Accommodation:**
- Book reputable hotels or hostels with good reviews
- Check reviews from solo female travellers specifically
- Heritage hotels in tourist areas are comfortable

**General:**
- Trust your instincts
- Avoid isolated areas after dark
- Be firm with persistent touts
- Indifference works better than politeness with harassers

### Areas to Avoid Alone at Night

- Empty bazaar lanes after closing time (8-9 PM)
- Areas around bus stands
- Poorly lit residential areas
- Construction zones

### Safe Areas

- MI Road after dark (busy, well-lit)
- Hotel areas in C-Scheme
- Main tourist spots until closing

---

## Night Safety

### Safe After Dark

- MI Road (restaurants, shops open late)
- C-Scheme (upscale, well-patrolled)
- Hotel complexes
- Main squares like Bani Park

### Use Caution

- Old city bazaars close by 8-9 PM and get deserted
- Side streets anywhere
- Areas around Sindhi Camp bus station

### Tips

1. Use app-based transport (Uber/Ola) not street autos
2. Stay in groups when possible
3. Tell your hotel when you're going out late
4. Keep phone charged and location shared

## Street Food Safety

Jaipur's street food is generally safe if you're smart:

**Safe bets:**
- High-turnover stalls (busy = fresh)
- Freshly cooked items (not sitting out)
- Famous established vendors (Rawat Kachori, LMB)
- Packaged items like namkeen

**Avoid:**
- Pre-cut fruit from street vendors
- Ice at street stalls
- Quiet stalls with no customers
- Anything sitting out for hours

**Tips:**
- Start cautiously, then expand
- Carry ORS sachets from pharmacy
- Bottled water only
- See our [food guide](/jaipur/food-guide/) for trusted recommendations

---

## Traffic Safety

Jaipur traffic follows its own rules. Pedestrians don't have automatic right of way.

**Crossing streets:**
- Find a local and walk with them
- Move steadily — don't stop mid-road
- Eye contact with drivers helps
- Use zebra crossings where they exist (rare)

**In vehicles:**
- Wear seatbelt in cars
- Hold on in autos
- Don't put limbs outside vehicle

---

## Health Safety

### Water
- Don't drink tap water
- Bottled water everywhere (check seal)
- Avoid ice at street stalls

### Sun
- Carry water always
- Sunscreen essential
- Hat recommended
- Take breaks in shade/AC

### Medical
- Pharmacies are everywhere
- Fortis and Narayana hospitals for serious issues
- Travel insurance strongly recommended

## Quick Safety Tips

1. **Ignore unsolicited help** — anyone who approaches you first likely wants something
2. **Book through apps** — Uber/Ola, hotel recommendations
3. **Know fair prices** — auto fare ₹50-300, entry fees ₹50-500
4. **Carry small notes** — easier to pay exact amounts
5. **Trust your instincts** — if something feels wrong, leave
6. **Be firm, not rude** — a clear "no" is more effective than long explanations
7. **Don't flash valuables** — keep expensive items discreet
8. **Save emergency numbers** — before you need them
