faq:
  - question: "What are the best day trips from Jaipur?"
    answer: "Top day trips: Pushkar (sacred lake, hippie vibes), Abhaneri (Chand Baori stepwell), Ajmer (Sufi shrine), Bhangarh (ghost fort). Ranthambore is doable as a day trip but better overnight for safaris."
  - question: "Can you do Pushkar as a day trip from Jaipur?"
    answer: "Yes. Pushkar is 150 km (3 hours) from Jaipur. A full day trip works — leave early, spend 4-5 hours exploring the lake, temples, and bazaar, return by evening. Overnight is better if you want camel safaris or Pushkar Fair."
  - question: "Can you do Ranthambore as a day trip from Jaipur?"
    answer: "Technically yes, but it's tight. The drive is 3.5 hours each way. For a proper tiger safari experience with good timing, stay overnight in Sawai Madhopur. Day trips mean rushing and missing dawn safaris."
