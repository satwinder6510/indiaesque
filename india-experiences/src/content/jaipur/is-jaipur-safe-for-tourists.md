**Yes, Jaipur is generally safe for tourists, but you need to stay alert for common scams and choose your areas wisely. The modern parts of the city are significantly safer than the Old City.**

Jaipur sees millions of tourists annually, and serious incidents are rare. However, like any major tourist destination, petty crime and scams exist. Your safety largely depends on where you go and how aware you stay.

## Old City vs New Jaipur Safety

The Old City around Amer Road, Chaura Rasta, and near City Palace has more safety concerns. Streets are narrow, crowded, and filled with aggressive vendors. You'll face constant harassment from touts selling everything from postcards to precious stones.

New Jaipur areas like C-Scheme, MI Road, and Malviya Nagar are much safer. These areas have better street lighting, regular police patrols, and fewer tourist-targeting scams. The roads are wider, and you can walk around without constant vendor harassment.

Bani Park, where many hotels are located, falls somewhere in between. It's safer than the Old City but requires normal city precautions, especially after dark.

## Common Scams Near Tourist Areas

### Gem and Jewelry Scams

The area around City Palace and Hawa Mahal is notorious for gem scams. Here's how they work: A friendly local approaches you, starts a conversation, then invites you for tea at their "family business." They show you gems or carpets, claim they're wholesale dealers, and offer you a "business opportunity" to buy and resell in your home country.

They provide fake certificates, promise shipping, and pressure you to pay thousands of rupees (often ₹50,000-₹200,000 or $600-$2,400). The items never arrive, or if they do, they're worthless.

### Rickshaw and Taxi Scams

Auto-rickshaw drivers often claim their meters are broken and quote inflated prices. A ride that should cost ₹80 ($1) suddenly becomes ₹300 ($3.50). They also take you to shops where they earn commissions, claiming your destination is closed.

### Fake Travel Agencies

Several fake travel agencies operate near the railway station and main tourist areas. They offer incredibly cheap tour packages but disappear with your money. Only book through registered agencies or your hotel.

## Women's Safety in Jaipur

Women traveling alone need extra precautions but can explore Jaipur safely. Dress conservatively - cover your shoulders and wear long pants or skirts. Tank tops and shorts attract unwanted attention.

Stay in well-reviewed hotels in safe areas like C-Scheme or MI Road. Avoid walking alone after 9 PM, especially in Old City areas. During the day, the main tourist sites are generally safe with good police presence.

If you face harassment, be firm and loud. Most vendors back off quickly when you make a scene. Indian women are often helpful if you need assistance.

## Safe Transportation Options

### Reliable Taxi Services

- **Uber and Ola**: Both operate in Jaipur with GPS tracking and cashless payments
- **Pre-paid taxi counters**: Available at the airport and railway station
- **Hotel taxis**: More expensive but reliable and safe

### Avoid These Transport Options

- Random auto-rickshaws without meters
- Unmarked private cars offering rides
- Motorcycle taxis (not legal in Jaipur)

## Safest Areas to Stay and Visit

### Recommended Safe Areas

**C-Scheme**: Modern commercial area with malls, restaurants, and good hotels. Well-lit streets and regular police patrols.

**MI Road**: Main shopping street with heavy foot traffic during the day. Safe for evening walks but stick to the main road.

**Bani Park**: Popular hotel area with decent safety standards. Walking distance to major attractions.

### Areas Requiring Extra Caution

**Johari Bazaar and Bapu Bazaar**: Crowded markets where pickpocketing occurs. Keep valuables secure.

**Areas around City Palace after dark**: Narrow lanes with poor lighting. Visit during daylight hours.

## Health and Medical Safety

Jaipur has good medical facilities. Fortis Hospital on Malviya Nagar and Eternal Heart Care Centre are excellent private hospitals. For minor issues, Apollo Pharmacy outlets are everywhere.

Drink bottled water and eat at busy restaurants. Street food from popular vendors is generally safe - look for places with high turnover and local customers. Check out our guide on [best street food in Jaipur](../best-street-food-jaipur/) for recommended spots.

## Emergency Contacts and Resources

- **Police**: 100
- **Tourist Helpline**: 1363
- **Fire**: 101
- **Medical Emergency**: 108
- **Tourist Police Station**: 0141-511-0426 (near Hawa Mahal)

Keep these numbers saved and share your itinerary with someone back home. The tourist police are specifically trained to help foreign visitors and speak English.

## Money and Valuables Safety

Use hotel safes for passports and extra cash. Carry photocopies of important documents. ATMs in malls and hotels are safer than street-side ones.

Bargaining is expected, but don't flash large amounts of cash. Use smaller bills for purchases and keep your main money stash separate.
