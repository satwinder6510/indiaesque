**Bapu Bazaar is Jaipur's textile paradise, offering bandhani scarves (₹200-1500), block-printed fabrics, leather juttis (₹300-1200), and expert tailoring services at wholesale prices that beat most tourist markets.**

Located near the Pink City's heart, Bapu Bazaar runs parallel to the famous Johari Bazaar and connects directly to Nehru Bazaar, making it a textile shopping powerhouse. The narrow lanes pack over 300 shops selling everything from traditional Rajasthani fabrics to modern Indo-western designs.

## Bandhani Scarves and Dupattas

Bandhani (tie-dye) scarves are Bapu Bazaar's crown jewel. You'll find authentic Rajasthani bandhani starting at ₹200 ($2.40) for basic cotton dupattas and reaching ₹1,500 ($18) for premium silk versions with intricate patterns.

**Quality indicators for bandhani:**
- Even dot patterns without bleeding colors
- Soft fabric that doesn't feel stiff from chemical processing  
- Natural color variations showing hand-dyeing process
- Price reflects fabric quality - pure silk costs ₹800-1500, cotton ₹200-600

The wholesale section on Bapu Bazaar's eastern end offers bulk rates - buy 5 scarves and save 20-30%. Shopkeepers like Ramesh Textiles and Maharaja Bandhani House have been family businesses for decades and offer authentic pieces.

## Block-Printed Fabrics

Bapu Bazaar stocks the largest selection of block-printed cotton in Jaipur. Prices start at ₹80 ($1) per meter for simple prints and go up to ₹400 ($4.80) per meter for complex multi-color designs using natural dyes.

**What to look for:**
- Hand-block prints show slight irregularities (this is good - proves authenticity)
- Colors that don't run when you rub with a white cloth
- Cotton that feels substantial, not thin or flimsy
- Sharp, clear print edges without smudging

Popular shops like Anokhi Textiles and Soma Block Prints offer fabric by the meter or ready-made items. Many shops also sell unstitched kurta sets (3 meters) for ₹600-1200 ($7-14).

## Leather Juttis

Traditional Rajasthani juttis (pointed-toe leather shoes) range from ₹300-1200 ($3.60-14) depending on leather quality and embroidery work. The leather market section near Bapu Bazaar's northern entrance has the best selection.

**Jutty buying tips:**
- Genuine leather feels supple, not plastic-like
- Check stitching quality around the sole
- Embroidered juttis cost ₹600-1200, plain ones ₹300-600
- Buy half a size larger than your normal shoe size

Mojari shops like Khan Leather Works and Rajasthani Mojari House offer custom sizing if you're staying in Jaipur for a few days.

## Custom Tailoring Services

Bapu Bazaar's tailors can stitch kurtas, salwar suits, and western clothes within 24-48 hours. Tailoring costs ₹200-500 ($2.40-6) for basic kurtas and ₹400-800 ($4.80-9.60) for detailed work.

**Best tailoring shops:**
- Master Tailor (near Sanganeri Gate) - specializes in fitted kurtas
- Raj Tailors - known for quick turnaround times
- New Fashion Point - handles western alterations

Bring a well-fitting garment as reference. Most tailors speak basic English and understand international sizing.

## Wholesale vs Retail Areas

**Wholesale section:** Eastern lanes near Choti Chaupar offer bulk rates but minimum purchases of 5-10 items. Prices are 30-40% lower than retail.

**Retail section:** Main Bapu Bazaar road caters to individual shoppers with fixed prices and English-speaking staff.

The wholesale area gets busy 10am-1pm when local retailers stock up. Visit after 2pm for relaxed browsing and better attention from shopkeepers.

## Bapu Bazaar vs Nehru Bazaar

**Bapu Bazaar advantages:**
- Better textile prices (20-30% cheaper)
- Authentic wholesale options  
- Larger fabric selection
- Professional tailoring services

**Nehru Bazaar advantages:**
- More handicrafts variety
- Tourist-friendly fixed prices
- Easier navigation
- Better for quick souvenir shopping

For serious textile shopping, choose Bapu Bazaar. For general souvenirs mixed with some fabrics, Nehru Bazaar works fine.

## Shopping Tips and Etiquette

Start negotiations at 40-50% of the quoted price for retail shops, 60-70% for wholesale vendors. Cash payments get better deals than cards.

Peak hours (11am-1pm and 4pm-7pm) mean crowded lanes but active atmosphere. Early morning (9am-11am) offers peaceful shopping with hungry shopkeepers ready to negotiate.

Most shops close during lunch (1:30-3pm) and on Sundays. Plan accordingly, especially if you need tailoring work completed.

The market connects easily with other [things to do in Jaipur](/jaipur/) - combine your shopping trip with visits to nearby City Palace or Hawa Mahal. Check our [getting around Jaipur](/jaipur/getting-around-jaipur/) guide for transportation options.
