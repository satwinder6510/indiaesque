Jaipur is compact compared to Delhi or Mumbai, but its neighbourhoods have distinct characters. The walled Pink City is the heritage core; surrounding areas offer better hotels and dining. Most tourist activity happens within a 5-km radius of the old city.

This guide breaks down Jaipur's key areas for visitors. For accommodation recommendations, see our [where to stay guide](/jaipur/where-to-stay-jaipur/).
