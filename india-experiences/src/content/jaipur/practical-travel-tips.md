Jaipur is more manageable than Delhi but still requires some planning. Here's everything practical you need to know.

## Budget Planning

### Daily Costs

| Style | Accommodation | Food | Transport | Total/Day |
|-------|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Budget | ₹800-1,500 | ₹500-800 | ₹300-500 | ₹2,000-3,000 |
| Mid-range | ₹3,000-5,000 | ₹1,000-1,500 | ₹800-1,200 | ₹5,000-8,000 |
| Luxury | ₹10,000+ | ₹3,000+ | ₹2,000+ | ₹15,000+ |

### Entry Fees

Major monuments have a composite ticket:
- **Composite ticket:** ₹500 for foreigners (covers Amber Fort, Nahargarh, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, Albert Hall)
- Valid for 2 days
- Buy at any included monument
- Individual tickets cost more if bought separately

### Money-Saving Tips

1. **Buy the composite ticket** — saves ₹300+ over individual entries
2. **Eat street food for lunch** — ₹100-200 for a full meal
3. **Use city buses or shared autos** — fraction of private auto cost
4. **Visit free attractions** — Birla Mandir, markets, street walks
5. **Stay in old city** — walking distance to major sights
6. **Bargain in markets** — start at 40% of quoted price

## Money and Currency

### Cash

- **Currency:** Indian Rupee (INR/₹)
- **ATMs:** Widespread — HDFC, ICICI, SBI most reliable
- **Withdrawal limits:** ₹10,000-20,000 per transaction
- **Small notes:** Essential for autos, street food, tips

### Cards

- Accepted at hotels, restaurants, larger shops
- Not useful in markets or for street vendors
- Visa/Mastercard work best
- Inform your bank of travel dates

### UPI Payments

Google Pay and PhonePe are everywhere — but require Indian bank account. Tourists typically use cash or cards.

### Money Exchange

- Airport rates are poor
- Better rates at Thomas Cook or city exchange shops
- Hotels offer convenience at worse rates
- ATMs are usually your best option

## SIM Cards and Internet

### Getting a SIM

**At the airport:**
- Jio and Airtel counters in arrivals
- Tourist SIMs: ₹500-700 for 28 days, 1.5-2GB daily data
- Bring passport and one photo
- Activation: 1-4 hours (sometimes instant)

**In the city:**
- Any Airtel/Jio store
- Same documents required
- Process can be slower

### Which Provider?

**Jio:** Best coverage, cheapest data, sometimes patchy in rural areas
**Airtel:** Reliable, slightly more expensive, good 4G

### Tips

- Airport purchase is easiest
- Get SIM before leaving airport
- Data is cheap — get a plan with plenty
- Most hotels have decent WiFi as backup

## First-Time Visitor Guide

### What to Expect

Jaipur is calmer than Delhi but still intense by Western standards. The old walled city is where most attractions are — it's walkable but chaotic. Traffic follows rough rules. Cows wander freely.

### Essential Knowledge

**Timing:**
- Start early — forts open 8-9 AM
- Midday heat is brutal (especially March-June)
- Most sights close by 5-6 PM
- Shops in old city close by 8 PM

**Dress:**
- Cover shoulders and knees at temples
- Comfortable walking shoes (uneven streets)
- Sun protection essential

**Cultural:**
- Remove shoes at temples and some palaces
- Ask before photographing people
- Haggling is expected in markets
- Tipping: 10% at restaurants, small notes for services

### Common Mistakes

1. **Booking too few days** — 2 days minimum, 3 ideal
2. **Underestimating distances** — the city is spread out
3. **Not bargaining** — you'll pay 3x the fair price
4. **Midday sightseeing** — exhausting in any season
5. **Trusting auto drivers' recommendations** — commission-based
