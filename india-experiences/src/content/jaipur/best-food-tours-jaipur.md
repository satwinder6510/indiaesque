## Best Operators and Booking Tips

**Jaipur Food Walk Company** gets consistently high reviews for knowledgeable guides who speak excellent English and share historical context with each dish. Book through their website for ₹200 discount on groups of 4+.

**Pink City Food Tours** offers the best photography opportunities with Instagram-worthy stops planned into their routes. Their guides carry professional cameras and take photos throughout the tour.

**Local Aromas** provides the most flexible scheduling with private tours available from ₹3,500 ($42) for two people. They customize routes based on your preferences and dietary needs.

WhatsApp booking works fastest with most operators. Pay cash on the day of the tour - cards often aren't accepted.

## Dietary Accommodations

Jaipur's strong vegetarian culture makes meat-free tours easy to arrange. Most operators offer separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian options without cross-contamination concerns.

For vegan requirements, specify "no dairy, no ghee" when booking. Operators know suitable alternatives like coconut oil-based dishes and dairy-free sweets.

Gluten-free options exist but require specific communication. Traditional dishes like bajre ki roti (millet bread) and rice-based items work well. Inform operators 48 hours in advance for best accommodations.

Spice levels can be adjusted at most stops. Request "kam mirch" (less spice) when ordering. Lassi and mishri help cool your palate between spicy dishes.

Plan your [Jaipur itinerary]((/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/)) to include food tours on your second or third day after you've adjusted to local flavors. This timing works better than diving straight into street food on arrival.
