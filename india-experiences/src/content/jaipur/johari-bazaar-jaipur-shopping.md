**Johari Bazaar is Jaipur's premier jewelry market located 200 meters from Hawa Mahal, specializing in silver jewelry (₹500-5,000/$6-60), precious gems (₹1,000-50,000/$12-600), and traditional kundan work. Shop with certified dealers displaying BIS hallmarks and gemological certificates to avoid the numerous fake stone vendors targeting tourists.**

This 400-year-old market operates from 10 AM to 8 PM and attracts jewelry buyers from across India. You'll find everything from affordable silver earrings to expensive emeralds and diamonds, but knowing how to navigate the certified dealers versus tourist traps makes the difference between a great purchase and an expensive mistake.

## Location and Getting There

Johari Bazaar sits in the heart of Old City, just off Tripolia Gate Road. The market stretches for 500 meters between Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar, making it easy to combine with your [sightseeing in Jaipur](/jaipur/).

**Best access points:**
- Main entrance: Opposite Hawa Mahal on Hawa Mahal Road
- Secondary entrance: From Jantar Mantar side via Tripolia Bazaar
- Auto-rickshaw fare: ₹100-150 ($1.20-1.80) from major hotels
- Walking distance: 15 minutes from City Palace, 10 minutes from Jantar Mantar

The narrow lanes get crowded after 2 PM, so visit in the morning for comfortable shopping and better attention from shopkeepers.

## Parking Options

**Paid parking lots:**
- Hawa Mahal parking: ₹20 per hour, 100-meter walk to bazaar
- City Palace parking: ₹30 per hour, 300-meter walk
- Jantar Mantar parking: ₹25 per hour, 200-meter walk

Avoid street parking - traffic police frequently fine improperly parked vehicles ₹500-1,000 ($6-12). The paid lots are safer and you won't return to find your vehicle blocked by other cars.

## What to Buy: Jewelry Categories and Prices

### Silver Jewelry
Silver jewelry dominates Johari Bazaar, with prices varying significantly based on design complexity and silver purity.

**Price ranges:**
- Simple silver rings: ₹500-1,500 ($6-18)
- Silver earrings: ₹800-3,000 ($10-36)
- Silver necklaces: ₹2,000-8,000 ($24-96)
- Heavy silver bangles: ₹3,000-12,000 ($36-144)

Look for the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) hallmark - a small stamp showing silver purity (92.5% for sterling silver). Genuine dealers display this prominently and explain the hallmarking system.

### Traditional Kundan Work
Kundan jewelry represents Jaipur's 300-year-old jewelry-making tradition, involving gold foil and glass stones.

**Authentic kundan prices:**
- Kundan earrings: ₹2,000-15,000 ($24-180)
- Kundan necklace sets: ₹8,000-50,000 ($96-600)
- Kundan maang tikka: ₹3,000-20,000 ($36-240)

Real kundan uses gold foil backing and quality glass stones. Tourist versions use cheap metal and plastic stones at similar prices - examine the backing carefully.

### Precious and Semi-Precious Gems
Jaipur processes 80% of the world's gemstones, making it a global gem trading center.

**Gem price categories:**
- Semi-precious (amethyst, citrine, garnet): ₹1,000-10,000 ($12-120)
- Precious stones (ruby, sapphire, emerald): ₹10,000-50,000 ($120-600)
- High-end diamonds and rare gems: ₹50,000+ ($600+)

## Certified Dealers vs Tourist Shops

### Certified Dealers
Look for these indicators of legitimate gem dealers:
- Display gemological certificates from GIA, Gübelin, or SSEF
- Member certificates from Jaipur Jewellers Association
- BIS hallmark certification for precious metals
- Fixed-price tags (less negotiation but authentic products)
- Detailed invoices with stone specifications

**Recommended certified areas:** Shops numbered 1-50 on Johari Bazaar main street tend to be more established with proper certifications.

### Tourist Trap Warning Signs
Avoid shops showing these red flags:
- No certifications or hallmarks visible
- Prices "specially for you" that seem too good
- High-pressure sales tactics or time-limited offers
- Refusing to provide detailed invoices
- Located in narrow side lanes away from main bazaar

These shops often sell glass as gemstones or low-grade silver as premium quality.

## Gem Testing Tips to Avoid Fakes

### Silver Testing
- **Magnet test:** Real silver isn't magnetic - if it sticks to a magnet, it's fake
- **Ice test:** Place ice on silver - real silver conducts heat and melts ice quickly
- **Hallmark check:** Look for "92.5" or "925" stamps indicating sterling silver

### Gemstone Authentication
- **Ask for certificates:** Genuine gems above ₹5,000 ($60) should have lab certificates
- **Check inclusions:** Natural stones have internal flaws; glass stones look too perfect
- **Temperature test:** Real gems feel cool to touch and stay cool longer than glass
- **Weight comparison:** Natural stones feel heavier than synthetic alternatives

For expensive purchases above ₹20,000 ($240), insist on independent gemological testing at Jaipur's Gem Testing Laboratory on MI Road (₹500-2,000 testing fee/$6-24).

## Negotiation Strategy

Initial asking prices run 200-300% above fair market value. Follow this negotiation approach:

1. **Research first:** Check 3-4 shops for price comparison
2. **Start at 30%:** Offer 30% of the quoted price
3. **Walk away test:** Leave if they won't negotiate - genuine interest brings better offers
4. **Bundle deals:** Buy multiple items for better per-piece pricing
5. **Cash discount:** Offer cash payment for additional 5-10% discount

Expect final prices around 40-60% of initial quotes for authentic items.

## Best Shopping Strategy

Plan your Johari Bazaar visit as part of your [Jaipur itinerary](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/) with these tips:

**Morning approach (10 AM - 12 PM):**
- Less crowded for comfortable browsing
- Shopkeepers are fresh and more patient
- Better natural light for examining jewelry

**Afternoon considerations (2 PM - 6 PM):**
- Peak crowd time - expect delays
