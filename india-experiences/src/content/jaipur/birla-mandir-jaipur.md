**Birla Mandir Jaipur, also known as Laxmi Narayan Temple, is a stunning white marble Hindu temple located on Moti Dungri hill, 3km from the city center. Built by the Birla family in 1988, this modern temple offers free entry, wheelchair accessibility, and spectacular panoramic views of Jaipur.**

The temple stands as one of Jaipur's most photographed landmarks, attracting thousands of devotees and tourists daily. Unlike the historical forts and palaces that dominate Jaipur's landscape, Birla Mandir represents contemporary temple architecture at its finest.

## Architecture and Design

The entire temple structure is carved from pristine white marble, creating a striking contrast against Rajasthan's desert landscape. The main temple houses beautiful idols of Lord Vishnu (Narayan) and Goddess Lakshmi, intricately carved from single blocks of marble. The temple walls feature detailed carvings depicting scenes from Hindu scriptures, including the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads.

The temple complex includes three domes representing the three approaches to religion - devotion, knowledge, and action. Each dome showcases different architectural elements, with detailed work that rivals any historical monument in the city. The marble changes color throughout the day, appearing golden during sunrise and sunset, and brilliant white during midday.

## Evening Illumination Experience

Visit Birla Mandir after sunset for the most spectacular experience. The temple illumination begins at 7:00 PM daily, transforming the white marble into a glowing beacon visible from across the city.
