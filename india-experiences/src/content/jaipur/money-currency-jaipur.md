**The Indian Rupee (INR) is Jaipur's currency, with cash still king for street vendors and local markets. ATMs are abundant, cards work at most hotels and restaurants, and digital payments are rapidly growing in popularity across the city.**

Navigating money matters in Jaipur is straightforward once you understand the local payment landscape. The city has embraced both traditional cash transactions and modern digital payment methods, making it convenient for travelers to manage their finances during their stay.

## ATM Availability and Banking

ATMs are everywhere in Jaipur, particularly concentrated around MI Road, the railway station, and major tourist areas. You'll find machines from major Indian banks like SBI, HDFC, ICICI, and Axis Bank, most accepting international Visa and Mastercard debit cards.

The withdrawal limits typically range from ₹10,000-40,000 ($120-480) per transaction, depending on your bank and card type. Most ATMs dispense ₹100, ₹500, and ₹2,000 notes, though ₹2,000 notes can be difficult to break at small vendors.

For reliable ATM access, head to:
- MI Road area near Panch Batti
- Jaipur Railway Station complex
- Major shopping areas like Bapu Bazaar
- Hotel clusters in Civil Lines
- Amber Fort entrance area

Withdrawal fees range from ₹20-50 ($0.25-0.60) per transaction for domestic cards, while international cards face charges of ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) plus your home bank's foreign transaction fees.

## Card Acceptance at Hotels and Restaurants

Most mid-range and upscale establishments accept credit cards, but cash remains essential for authentic local experiences. Hotels rated 3-star and above universally accept international cards, while budget guesthouses and homestays often prefer cash payments.

Restaurants along MI Road, in shopping malls, and tourist-focused establishments accept cards readily. However, the best local eateries and street food vendors operate cash-only. When [exploring Jaipur's incredible food scene](/jaipur/food/), carry sufficient cash for spontaneous culinary adventures.

Popular payment cards include:
- Visa and Mastercard (widely accepted)
- American Express (limited acceptance)
- RuPay (domestic Indian cards)

Always inform your bank about travel plans to avoid card blocks, and carry backup payment methods since card machines occasionally malfunction or lack internet connectivity.

## Forex Counters and Money Exchange

Currency exchange services cluster around MI Road and Jaipur Railway Station, offering competitive rates for major currencies. Authorized forex dealers provide better rates than hotels and accept USD, EUR, GBP, and other major currencies.

Key exchange locations include:
- MI Road between Panch Batti and Sindhi Camp
- Inside Jaipur Railway Station
- Major hotels (though rates are typically 2-3% lower)
- Authorized money changers near tourist areas

Banks like HDFC, ICICI, and SBI also exchange foreign currency, though they require more documentation and longer processing times. Current exchange rates hover around ₹83-85 per USD, ₹90-92 per EUR, and ₹105-108 per GBP, with slight variations between dealers.

## Tipping Guidelines

Tipping culture in Jaipur follows standard Indian practices with some tourist-area adjustments. At restaurants, tip 10-15% of the bill if no service charge is included. Many upscale restaurants automatically add a 10% service charge, making additional tipping optional.

For tour guides, budget ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) per person for half-day tours and ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) for full-day experiences. Licensed guides working major attractions like Amber Fort and City Palace typically receive higher tips due to their expertise and language skills.

Hotel tipping standards:
- Room service: ₹20-50 per delivery
- Housekeeping: ₹50-100 per night
- Bellhop: ₹50-100 for luggage assistance
- Concierge: ₹100-200 for special arrangements

Auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers don't expect tips, but rounding up the fare by ₹10-20 for good service is appreciated.

## Bargaining Culture

Bargaining is fundamental to Jaipur's shopping experience, especially in traditional markets like Bapu Bazaar, Johari Bazaar, and street-side vendors. Initial quoted prices can be 3-4 times the final selling price, particularly for tourists.

Start negotiations at 25-30% of the quoted price and work upward. Vendors expect this interaction and often enjoy the process. Fixed-price stores clearly display "Fixed Price" signs, while others welcome negotiation.

Items where bargaining is expected:
- Textiles and handicrafts
- Jewelry (except precious stones/metals)
- Souvenirs and decorative items
- Auto-rickshaw rides (though meters are required)

Government emporiums and established showrooms typically offer fixed prices with quality guarantees, eliminating bargaining but ensuring authenticity.

## Digital Payment Adoption

Jaipur has embraced digital payments rapidly, with UPI (Unified Payments Interface), Paytm, Google Pay, and PhonePe widely accepted. Even street vendors and small shops display QR codes for digital transactions.

Popular digital payment methods:
- UPI apps (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm)
- Mobile wallets
- QR code payments
- Contactless card payments

This digital adoption particularly benefits tourists using Indian SIM cards or international cards linked to digital wallets. Many vendors offer small discounts for digital payments to avoid cash handling.

Markets around MI Road, major tourist attractions, and modern shopping areas show highest digital payment adoption. Traditional bazaars still prefer cash but increasingly accept digital options.

## Budget Planning

Daily budget expectations vary significantly based on travel style. Budget travelers can manage on ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) daily, including accommodation, meals, and local transport. Mid-range travelers typically spend ₹3,000-6,000 ($36-72) daily, while luxury experiences can exceed ₹10,000 ($120) daily.

When [planning your Jaipur itinerary](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/), factor in entrance fees for major attractions (₹25-600 per site), meals (₹100-800 per meal), and transport costs. Having a mix of cash and card options ensures you can fully enjoy everything from street food to palace tours during your visit.
