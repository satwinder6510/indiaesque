**Jaipur experiences three distinct seasons: pleasant winters (October-March) with temperatures of 15-28°C, scorching summers (April-June) reaching 45°C, and moderate monsoons (July-September) with occasional heavy rainfall and high humidity.**

Planning your trip to the Pink City requires understanding its dramatic temperature swings and seasonal patterns. Here's what to expect each month so you can pack appropriately and make the most of your visit.

## October to March: Peak Tourist Season

### October
Temperature: 19-33°C (66-91°F)
Rainfall: Minimal (10-20mm)

October marks the beginning of Jaipur's [best travel season](/jaipur/best-time-visit-jaipur/). The oppressive summer heat finally breaks, making it perfect for exploring Amber Fort and City Palace. You'll need light cotton clothes during the day and a light sweater for evenings. This coincides with Diwali celebrations, so book accommodations early.

### November  
Temperature: 13-28°C (55-82°F)
Rainfall: Nearly zero

November offers ideal weather for sightseeing. Mornings are crisp and cool, perfect for visiting Nahargarh Fort or exploring the Pink City's bazaars. Pack layers - cotton shirts for afternoons and light woolens for early morning and evening. Hotel rates start climbing as peak season approaches.

### December
Temperature: 8-23°C (46-73°F)  
Rainfall: Rare

December brings Jaipur's coolest temperatures. You'll definitely need warm clothes - pack a jacket, sweaters, and closed shoes. The weather is perfect for [exploring Jaipur's attractions](/jaipur/) without breaking a sweat. This is peak tourist season, so expect crowded monuments and higher prices for everything from hotels to rickshaws.

### January
Temperature: 5-22°C (41-72°F)
Rainfall: Occasional light showers

January is the coldest month. Early mornings can be surprisingly chilly at 5-8°C, but afternoons warm up beautifully. Pack warm layers, including a proper winter jacket. The clear skies make this perfect for photography at Hawa Mahal and Jal Mahal.

### February  
Temperature: 8-25°C (46-77°F)
Rainfall: Light, infrequent

February offers comfortable weather with warming temperatures. You still need light woolens for mornings and evenings, but can switch to cotton during the day. This is an excellent time to [plan your Jaipur itinerary](/jaipur/how-many-days-jaipur/) as the weather won't limit your activities.

### March
Temperature: 14-30°C (57-86°F)
Rainfall: Minimal

March sees temperatures starting to climb. Days become noticeably warmer while nights remain pleasant. Pack mostly cotton clothes with one light sweater. Holi celebrations happen during this month, adding color to your visit but requiring clothes you don't mind getting stained.

## April to June: Summer Heat Warning

### April
Temperature: 20-36°C (68-97°F)
Rainfall: Rare

April marks the beginning of Jaipur's brutal summer. The heat becomes uncomfortable by mid-morning, making early morning visits to outdoor attractions essential. Pack light, breathable cotton clothes, a wide-brimmed hat, and strong sunscreen. Avoid synthetic fabrics completely.

### May  
Temperature: 26-42°C (79-108°F)
Rainfall: Occasional dust storms

May is brutal. Temperatures regularly exceed 40°C (104°F), and the sun is merciless. Plan indoor activities during midday hours - visit museums, shop in air-conditioned malls, or rest at your hotel. If you must go out, stick to early morning (before 9 AM) or evening (after 6 PM). 

### June
Temperature: 28-45°C (82-113°F)  
Rainfall: Pre-monsoon showers possible

June represents peak summer heat. The scorching temperatures make daytime sightseeing nearly impossible. Many locals take afternoon naps to avoid the heat. Pack the lightest cotton clothes possible, carry water constantly, and plan most activities before sunrise or after sunset.

## July to September: Monsoon Season

### July
Temperature: 26-35°C (79-95°F)
Rainfall: 200-250mm

July brings monsoon relief from the heat, but introduces new challenges. The humidity spikes, making 35°C feel much hotter. Pack quick-dry clothes, waterproof shoes, and a compact umbrella. Rain can be heavy but usually comes in short bursts. Many outdoor monuments may have slippery surfaces.

### August  
Temperature: 24-33°C (75-91°F)
Rainfall: 250-300mm (wettest month)

August sees the heaviest rainfall. While temperatures drop, humidity remains high. The rain can disrupt travel plans, so build flexibility into your [Jaipur itinerary](/jaipur/jaipur-travel-tips-first-time/). Pack waterproof bags for electronics and avoid white or light-colored clothes that show water stains easily.

### September
Temperature: 24-34°C (75-93°F)  
Rainfall: 100-150mm

September marks the monsoon's retreat. Rain becomes less frequent, but humidity remains high. The weather starts improving toward month-end, making late September a good compromise between fewer crowds and decent weather conditions.

## Festival Season Weather Overlap

Jaipur's major festivals coincide with pleasant weather. Diwali (October/November) enjoys perfect temperatures for evening celebrations. Holi (March) happens during warming but still comfortable weather. The Jaipur Literature Festival (January) takes advantage of the coolest, driest conditions.

## Essential Packing Tips by Season

**Winter (Oct-Mar)**: Layers are key. Pack cotton for warm afternoons, light woolens for evenings, and a proper jacket for December-January mornings.

**Summer (Apr-Jun)**: Light cotton only. Avoid jeans, synthetic fabrics, and dark colors. A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses are essential.

**Monsoon (Jul-Sep)**: Quick-dry synthetic clothes work better than cotton. Pack waterproof shoes and keep electronics in waterproof bags.
