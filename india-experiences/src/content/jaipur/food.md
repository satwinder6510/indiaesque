Jaipur's food scene combines traditional Rajasthani flavors with modern dining experiences. From street-side kachoris to rooftop restaurants overlooking Amber Fort, the Pink City offers everything from ₹50 ($0.60) snacks to ₹1,500 ($18) heritage dining experiences.

The city's cuisine centers around hearty dishes designed for desert life - rich gravies, ghee-laden breads, and sweet treats that provide energy and comfort. You'll taste influences from royal kitchens, local street culture, and neighboring states.

## Traditional Rajasthani Dishes You Can't Miss

**Ghewar** dominates Jaipur's sweet scene, especially during festivals. This disc-shaped dessert made from flour and soaked in sugar syrup comes in various flavors. Rawat Mishtan Bhandar near Sindhi Camp makes fresh ghewar daily, priced at ₹180-350 ($2.15-$4.20) per kg.

**Pyaaz Kachori** represents Jaipur's street food excellence. These deep-fried pastries filled with spiced onions cost ₹15-25 ($0.18-$0.30) each. The original Rawat Kachori shop on Station Road has been serving them since 1936.

## Street Food Safety and Tips

Stick to busy stalls with high turnover - fresh preparation reduces health risks. Look for vendors using bottled water for drinks and maintaining clean cooking areas. Popular spots like Rawat Kachori and LMB maintain consistent quality due to their reputation.

Avoid unpeeled fruits, ice in drinks, and raw salads unless from established restaurants. Carry hand sanitizer and drink bottled water. Most travelers experience no issues following these basic precautions.
