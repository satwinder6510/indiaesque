**Jaigarh Fort, known as the Victory Fort, sits 15 kilometers from Jaipur city center and houses the world's largest cannon, Jaivana. Built in 1726 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, this fort requires 2-3 hours to explore and offers combined tickets with Amber Fort for ₹100 ($1.20) extra.**

Perched 400 meters above sea level on the Aravalli hills, Jaigarh Fort served as a military stronghold protecting the Amber Fort below. The red sandstone structure spans 3 kilometers and connects directly to Amber Fort through underground passages, making it one of Rajasthan's most strategically important fortifications.

## The Jaivana Cannon — World's Largest Artillery Piece

The star attraction of Jaigarh Fort is the massive Jaivana cannon, officially recognized as the world's largest wheeled cannon. This engineering marvel weighs 50 tons and measures 20.2 feet in length with a barrel diameter of 11 inches.

Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II commissioned the cannon in 1720. The foundry workers created it entirely within the fort premises, and it remains in its original position today. The cannon was test-fired only once, sending a cannonball 35 kilometers to create a pond that locals still call "Gola ka Talab" (Cannonball Pond).

The Jaivana required 100 kilograms of gunpowder for a single shot. Four wheels, each 9 feet in diameter, support the massive structure. You can climb onto the platform surrounding the cannon for close-up photos and detailed examination of the intricate metalwork.

## Armory Museum and Military Heritage

The fort's armory museum displays one of India's finest collections of medieval weapons. The museum houses over 1,000 artifacts including swords, daggers, cannons, firearms, and armor pieces dating from the 12th to 18th centuries.

Notable exhibits include:
- Curved swords with jeweled hilts belonging to various Maharajas
- Chain mail armor that weighs over 40 kilograms
- Miniature cannons used for ceremonial purposes  
- Flintlock pistols imported from Europe
- Traditional Rajasthani shields decorated with brass work

The museum's gun foundry section shows how weapons were manufactured within the fort. Original furnaces, molds, and tools demonstrate the sophisticated metallurgy techniques used by royal craftsmen.

## Treasure Excavation Stories and Underground Mysteries

Jaigarh Fort carries legendary stories about hidden treasures buried within its walls. In 1977, the Indian government conducted official excavations based on historical records suggesting Maharaja Man Singh I buried Mughal Emperor Akbar's treasure here after his military campaigns.

The Archaeological Survey of India spent months digging in the fort's underground chambers and found evidence of secret vaults, but no treasure emerged. Local legends persist about seven stories of underground chambers filled with gold, silver, and precious stones.

You can explore several underground sections today, including water storage tanks and grain storage areas. The Subterranean three-story structure includes living quarters for soldiers and multiple escape routes leading toward Amber Fort.
