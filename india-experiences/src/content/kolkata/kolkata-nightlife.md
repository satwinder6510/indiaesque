## Safety Tips for Night Out

Kolkata is generally safe for nightlife, but follow basic precautions. Book prepaid taxis or use app-based rides instead of walking late at night. Keep your belongings secure and avoid displaying expensive items openly.

Stay in groups when moving between venues, especially on weekends when crowds are larger. Most venues have security, but drink responsibly and watch your alcohol intake. For more detailed safety information, check our [guide on tourist safety in Kolkata](/kolkata/is-kolkata-safe-for-tourists/).

## Group Booking Advantages

Booking for groups of 6-8 people often gets you better deals. Many venues offer:
- Waived or reduced entry fees
- Table reservations without extra charges
- Drink packages at discounted rates
- Priority seating during busy nights

Contact venues directly for group rates, especially for birthday celebrations or corporate events.

## Getting Around After Hours

Most venues close between 1-2 AM, when public transport stops running. Pre-book return transportation or use ride-hailing apps. Uber and Ola operate throughout the night with surge pricing after midnight.

If you're staying in central Kolkata, many hotels are within ₹200-300 ($2.50-3.50) auto-rickshaw ride from Park Street. For accommodation recommendations near nightlife areas, see our [guide on where to stay in Kolkata](/kolkata/where-to-stay-kolkata/).

## Alternative Nightlife Areas

Beyond Park Street, explore Salt Lake's pubs and bars for a more local experience. Areas around New Market and Esplanade also have smaller bars with different atmospheres. These venues typically charge lower entry fees (₹300-600) but have limited music and dancing options.

## Planning Your Night Out

Combine your nightlife experience with Kolkata's food scene by starting with dinner at Park Street restaurants before hitting the bars. Many venues offer food menus, but the quality varies.
