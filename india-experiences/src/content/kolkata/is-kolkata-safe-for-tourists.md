## Safety by Neighborhood

### Safest Areas for Tourists

**Park Street and surrounding areas** remain the safest bet for tourists. This central district has good police presence, well-lit streets, and plenty of people around even late at night. Hotels here are secure and you're walking distance from major attractions.

**Ballygunge** offers upscale accommodation and excellent safety standards. The area has wide roads, good lighting, and minimal crime. It's where many business travelers and expats choose to stay.

**New Alipore** provides a quieter, residential feel while maintaining high safety standards. The tree-lined streets and embassy presence contribute to enhanced security.

**Salt Lake City (Bidhannagar)** is modern, planned, and very safe. If you're staying here, you'll find clean streets, organized traffic, and minimal crime.

### Areas to Be Cautious

**Sealdah station area** gets crowded and chaotic, especially at night. The surrounding streets have higher petty crime rates, so avoid walking alone after 9 PM.

**Parts of Howrah**, particularly near the railway station, can be overwhelming for first-time visitors. Stick to main roads and avoid narrow lanes after dark.

**North Kolkata's older sections** have narrow, poorly lit lanes that can feel intimidating at night. During the day, these areas are perfectly safe for exploring [heritage sites](/kolkata/heritage-sites/).

## Common Petty Crimes and Scams

### Taxi and Transport Scams

The most common issue tourists face involves taxi drivers. Many refuse to use meters and quote inflated fixed prices. At Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, some drivers charge ₹800-1,000 ($10-12) for rides that should cost ₹400-500 ($5-6).

**Solution**: Use app-based services like Uber or Ola, or the prepaid taxi counter at the airport. For local trips, insist on the meter or agree on the fare before starting.

### Market Overcharging

Tourists often get quoted higher prices at [markets](/kolkata/markets-shopping/), especially at New Market and Gariahat. Vendors may start at 3-4 times the actual price.

**Solution**: Always negotiate. Start at 30-40% of the quoted price and settle around 60-70%.

### Fake Tour Operators

Unauthorized guides approach tourists near major attractions like Victoria Memorial, offering "special tours" at inflated rates of ₹2,000-3,000 ($25-36) per person.

**Solution**: Book [food tours](/kolkata/food-tours/) and sightseeing through licensed operators or your hotel.

## Solo Female Travel Safety

Kolkata stands out among Indian cities for solo female traveler safety. Local culture respects women, and you'll find many Bengali women out alone, even in the evenings.

### Practical Tips

**Use women-only metro compartments** during rush hours (7-10 AM and 5-8 PM). The pink compartments at the front of trains provide additional comfort and safety.

**Choose accommodations wisely**. Stay in established areas like Park Street, Ballygunge, or near major metro stations. Budget options like backpacker hostels in Park Street area cost ₹800-1,200 ($10-15) per night.

**Transportation after dark**: Stick to app-based taxis rather than flagging down cabs. Metro services run until 10:45 PM on weekdays and are generally safe.

**Dress considerations**: Kolkata is liberal, but modest clothing helps you blend in better. You'll see local women in both traditional and western wear.

## Transportation Safety

### Metro System

Kolkata Metro is clean, punctual, and safe. At ₹5-15 ($0.06-0.18) per ride, it's your best option for getting around safely. Avoid empty compartments late at night and stay alert at busy stations like Esplanade and Sealdah.

### Taxis and Rideshares

Yellow taxis are iconic but often avoid using meters. App-based services like Uber and Ola provide transparent pricing and GPS tracking. A typical ride across central Kolkata costs ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40).

### Auto-rickshaws

Three-wheelers operate mainly in outer areas and suburbs. They're generally safe but negotiate fares beforehand as they rarely use meters.

## Emergency Contacts and Resources

**Tourist Helpline**: 1800-11-1363 (24/7, multilingual support)
**Police Emergency**: 100
**Fire Services**: 101
**Medical Emergency**: 108

**Tourist Police Stations**:

## Health and Medical Safety

Kolkata has excellent medical facilities. AMRI Hospitals, Apollo Gleneagles, and Fortis provide international-standard care. Consultation fees range from ₹500-1,500 ($6-18).

**Water safety**: Stick to bottled water costing ₹15-25 ($0.18-0.30) per liter. Most hotels provide complimentary bottles.

**Food safety**: Street food is generally safe if you choose busy stalls with high turnover. Start with milder options before trying spicier dishes.

## Money and Valuables

ATMs are widespread and secure. Use machines inside bank branches or malls rather than standalone roadside units. Most accept international cards with transaction fees of ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) per withdrawal.

Keep valuables in hotel safes. Petty theft is rare, but don't flash expensive jewelry or large amounts of cash unnecessarily.
