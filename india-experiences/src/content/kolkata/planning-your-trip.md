### Dates

### The Experience

**Idol Immersion:** On Vijaya Dashami (final day), idols are carried to the Hooghly River and immersed. Huge processions.

### Practical Puja Tips

1. **Book hotels 3-6 months ahead** — prices triple
2. **Wear comfortable shoes** — you'll walk kilometers
3. **Go late** — pandals are best after 10 PM
4. **Eat constantly** — food stalls everywhere
5. **Use metro** — roads are impossible
6. **Join the locals** — Bengalis are welcoming
7. **Expect no sleep** — the city doesn't sleep
