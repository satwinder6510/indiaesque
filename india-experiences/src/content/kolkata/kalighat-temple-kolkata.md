**Kalighat Temple is one of the 51 sacred Shakti Peethas where Goddess Kali's toes are believed to have fallen. Located in South Kolkata, this 200-year-old temple operates from 5 AM-2 PM and 5-10:30 PM daily, attracting thousands of devotees seeking blessings from the fierce goddess.**

Kalighat Temple stands as the spiritual heart of Kolkata, drawing pilgrims from across India to worship Goddess Kali in her most powerful form. The current temple structure dates to 1809, built on a site that's been sacred for over 500 years.

## Spiritual Significance and History

As one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, Kalighat holds immense religious importance in Hindu mythology. Legend says Goddess Sati's right toe fell here when Lord Shiva carried her dismembered body across the universe. The temple's black stone idol of Kali, with her distinctive large eyes and protruding golden tongue, represents the goddess as the destroyer of evil.

The name "Kalikshetra" (Kali's place) eventually became "Kalighat," which gave Calcutta and later Kolkata its name. Bengali poet Ramprasad Sen composed many devotional songs here in the 18th century, cementing the temple's cultural significance.

## Temple Timings and Best Time to Visit

The temple opens at 5 AM for morning prayers and closes at 2 PM for the midday break. Evening prayers resume at 5 PM and continue until 10:30 PM. The afternoon closure allows priests to rest and complete maintenance work.

Visit between 6-8 AM for a peaceful darshan with manageable crowds. Avoid Tuesday, Saturday, and Amavasya (new moon) when devotee numbers peak. During Kali Puja in October-November, expect 2-3 hour wait times even in early morning.

## Getting There and Metro Connectivity

Take the Purple Line metro to Kalighat Station, located just 500 meters from the temple. Exit through Gate 1 and walk straight down Anami Sangha Street. The metro journey costs ₹10-25 ($0.12-0.30) depending on your starting point.

Buses 45, 45A, and S4 also stop near the temple. If traveling by taxi or rideshare, ask to be dropped at Kalighat Temple Road. Parking is extremely limited, so public transport is your best option. Check our [Kolkata transport guide](/kolkata/kolkata-transport-guide/) for detailed metro information.

## Dress Code and Temple Etiquette

Wear modest, traditional clothing covering shoulders and knees. Many devotees choose red or yellow colors, considered auspicious for Kali worship. Remove shoes at designated areas and carry them in provided bags (shoe-keeping charges: ₹10-20).

Photography is strictly prohibited inside the main temple. Mobile phones should be on silent mode. Join the queue for darshan and maintain respectful silence near the deity. Don't touch the idol or temple walls without permission.

## Offerings and Rituals

The temple accepts various offerings purchased from official counters:
- Red hibiscus flowers: ₹20-50 ($0.25-0.60)
- Sweets and prasad: ₹30-100 ($0.35-1.20)
- Coconut and banana: ₹40-80 ($0.50-1.00)
- Special puja services: ₹200-500 ($2.50-6.00)

Traditional animal sacrifice still occurs on specific days, particularly during Kali Puja and Durga Puja. Goats are sacrificed following ancient rituals, with the meat distributed among devotees. The practice continues despite ongoing debates about its place in modern worship.

## Scam Awareness and Safety Tips

Kalighat attracts numerous touts and fake priests targeting tourists. Common scams include:

**Overpriced flower sellers**: Buy offerings only from official temple counters with printed rates.

**Fake priests demanding donations**: Genuine temple priests don't aggressively demand money. Donations are voluntary.

**Inflated shoe-keeping charges**: Standard rates are ₹10-20. Don't pay more than ₹50.

**Fortune tellers and fake babas**: Avoid anyone offering predictions or special blessings for money outside the temple.

Keep bags zipped and avoid carrying large amounts of cash. The area is generally safe, but pickpocketing can occur in crowds. Read more about [staying safe in Kolkata](/kolkata/is-kolkata-safe-for-tourists/).

## Nearby Attractions

The Mother Teresa House (Motherhouse) sits just 1.5 kilometers from Kalighat Temple. This connection between Hindu spirituality and Christian service reflects Kolkata's diverse religious landscape. Mother Teresa often visited Kalighat and drew inspiration from the devotion she witnessed.

Other nearby sites include Kalighat Kali Temple Museum, showcasing the temple's history, and Nirmal Hriday (Home for Dying Destitutes) established by Mother Teresa. The area also features several traditional Bengali sweet shops and local markets.

## Planning Your Visit
