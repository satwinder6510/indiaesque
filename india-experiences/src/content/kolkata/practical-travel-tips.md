## Budget Planning

## Solo Travel

### The Culture

Kolkata has India's most intellectual atmosphere. Bengalis are readers, thinkers, conversationalists. The aggression found in other cities is less present here. Solo travellers often find it the most comfortable Indian metro.

### Solo Female Travel

**Generally safe.** Kolkata consistently ranks among India's safest cities. Women use public transport freely, including late evening.

**Recommendations:**
- Use Uber/Ola at night
- Metro has women's compartments
- Sudder Street and Park Street areas are comfortable
- Trust your instincts, as anywhere

**Safe areas for solo women:**
- Park Street / Camac Street
- Esplanade area
- Ballygunge / Gariahat
- Salt Lake

**More caution:**
- Howrah Station surroundings late at night
- Empty areas after midnight

### Why Solo Travellers Love Kolkata

- Easy to strike up conversations
- Coffee house culture welcomes solo sitting
- Bookshops everywhere
- Less hassle from touts than Delhi/Jaipur
- Cultural events often free or cheap

## First-Time Visitor Guide

### What to Expect

Kolkata is not the "dying city" of Western stereotypes. It's:
- Culturally alive (literature, music, film, art)
- Food paradise (Bengali cuisine, street food)
- Architecturally fascinating (British colonial + decay)
- Nostalgic and charming
- Slow-paced compared to Mumbai

### The Pace

Kolkata moves differently. Meetings start late. "Adda" (leisurely conversation) is valued. People have time. This can frustrate efficiency-seekers or delight culture-seekers.

### Key Experiences

1. **Walk across Howrah Bridge** at dawn
2. **Eat Bengali food** — fish, sweets, street food
3. **Victoria Memorial** — the Taj Mahal of Kolkata
4. **Coffee house adda** — Indian Coffee House
5. **Kumartuli** — idol-makers' village
6. **Durga Puja** (if October) — nothing else compares

### Common Mistakes

- **Expecting Mumbai/Delhi pace** — Kolkata is slower
- **Skipping the food** — Bengali cuisine is exceptional
- **Missing Kumartuli** — most unique neighbourhood
- **Not walking** — the city rewards walkers
- **Visiting only landmarks** — the neighbourhoods are the point

## Health and Safety

### Water

- Don't drink tap water
- Bottled water everywhere
- "Boiled water" at restaurants usually safe

### Food Safety

- Street food is generally safe (high turnover)
- Kolkata street food is excellent
- Start with phuchka, kathi rolls, jhalmuri
- Fish is the local specialty — eat at busy places

### Medical

- Pharmacies widespread
- Good hospitals: Apollo, AMRI, Belle Vue
- Travel insurance recommended

### Safety

Kolkata is quite safe. Main concerns:
- Pickpockets at Howrah Station
- Taxi overcharging (use apps)
- Crowded areas during Durga Puja
