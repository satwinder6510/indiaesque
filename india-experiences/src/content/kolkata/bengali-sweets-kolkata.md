**Kolkata's best Bengali sweets come from heritage shops like KC Das (original Rosogulla creators), Bhim Nag, Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy. You'll find premium Rosogulla at ₹120-150/kg, Sandesh at ₹200-300/kg, with most shops concentrated around Shyama Charan Mukherjee Street and College Street.**

Bengali sweets aren't just desserts in Kolkata - they're cultural institutions. Every neighborhood has its loyal customers who swear by specific shops, and the quality differences are real. The city's sweet-making tradition spans over 200 years, with recipes passed down through generations of confectioners.

## Top Sweet Shops You Can't Miss

### KC Das - The Rosogulla Pioneers
KC Das on Esplanade East started the Rosogulla revolution in 1868. Their original shop near Sealdah Station still uses the same copper vessels and traditional methods. The Rosogulla here costs ₹150 per kg ($1.80), slightly higher than competitors, but the texture is exceptional - perfectly spongy with the right amount of syrup absorption.

The shop offers guided tours of their kitchen between 10 AM-12 PM on weekdays for ₹200 per person ($2.40). You'll see the milk curdling process, the kneading technique for perfect chenna, and the precise timing for sugar syrup preparation.

### Bhim Nag - North Kolkata's Sweet Emperor
Located on Shyama Charan Mukherjee Street, Bhim Nag has been serving North Kolkata since 1920. Their Langcha (₹180/kg) and Pantua (₹160/kg) are exceptional. The shop's Kheer Kadam, with its perfectly balanced sweetness, costs ₹220 per kg ($2.65).

The family still hand-rolls every sweet. Their Sandesh varieties include seasonal flavors like mango (summer) and date palm jaggery (winter), priced at ₹280-320 per kg ($3.35-3.85).

### Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy
This Bagbazar institution, running since 1844, specializes in traditional sweets that many modern shops have abandoned. Their Sitabhog and Mihidana cost ₹240 per kg ($2.90). The shop's location near Sovabazar metro station makes it easily accessible.

Their Mishti Doi comes in earthen pots (₹60 each, $0.70) and has a distinctly tangy flavor profile that's become their signature.

## Must-Try Bengali Sweets

### Rosogulla - The Crown Jewel
Fresh Rosogulla should be white, spongy, and double in size when pressed gently. Quality shops sell them at ₹120-150 per kg. They stay fresh for 2-3 days refrigerated. Avoid shops where Rosogullas look yellowish or feel hard.

### Sandesh - The Artistic Sweet
Sandesh ranges from simple varieties (₹200/kg) to elaborate decorative pieces (₹400/kg). The base should taste of fresh chenna with minimal sugar. Popular varieties include Kanchagolla, Rajbhog, and seasonal fruit Sandesh.

### Mishti Doi - Sweet Yogurt Perfection
Good Mishti Doi has a caramelized color from slow-cooking milk and jaggery. Prices range from ₹40-80 per serving depending on the shop's reputation. The best versions come in traditional earthen pots that add a subtle earthy flavor.

### Rasamalai - The Creamy Delight
Rasamalai costs ₹180-220 per kg and consists of flattened Rosogulla pieces in thickened milk. The milk should be naturally sweet without artificial flavoring. This sweet has the shortest shelf life - consume within 24 hours.

## Shopping Tips and Storage

Buy sweets early morning (8-10 AM) when they're freshest. Most shops prepare their first batch by 7 AM. For festivals, place orders 2-3 days in advance as quality shops often run out.

Store Rosogulla and Rasamalai in the refrigerator in their original syrup. Sandesh stays fresh at room temperature for 6-8 hours, then refrigerate. Mishti Doi should always be kept cold.
