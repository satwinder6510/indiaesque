**Park Street is Kolkata's premier dining and entertainment district, famous for iconic restaurants like Peter Cat and Mocambo, vibrant nightlife, spectacular Christmas celebrations, and the historic Park Street Cemetery.**

This legendary street stretches from Park Circus to Chowringhee, packed with colonial-era buildings housing some of India's most famous restaurants and bars. You'll find everything from heritage eateries to modern pubs along this 2-kilometer stretch.

## Famous Restaurants on Park Street

### Peter Cat
The undisputed king of Park Street dining, Peter Cat has served its legendary Chelo Kebabs since 1975. The sizzling platter of mutton kebabs with Persian rice costs ₹650 ($8) and comes with their famous brown sauce. Expect a 30-45 minute wait during peak hours - no reservations accepted for the main dining hall.

The restaurant maintains a smart casual dress code. Shorts and flip-flops aren't allowed in the evening. Peak hours are 7:30-9:30 PM when queues stretch outside.

### Mocambo
This art deco restaurant from 1956 serves Continental cuisine in an elegant setting. Their Deviled Crab (₹850/$10) and Continental Platter (₹1200/$14) are exceptional. Unlike Peter Cat, Mocambo accepts reservations - book 2-3 days ahead for weekend dinners.

Smart casual dress required. Expect to spend ₹800-1500 ($10-18) per person including drinks.

### Trincas
More than just a restaurant, Trincas combines dining with live music. Their Thursday jazz nights and weekend bands create an authentic Park Street experience. Food is decent but you come here for the atmosphere. Cover charges apply during live shows (₹300-500/$4-6).

## Nightlife and Entertainment

Park Street transforms after dark. Someplace Else at The Park Hotel hosts live bands and DJs, with entry fees of ₹800-1500 ($10-18) including drinks. Shisha at The Astor Hotel offers a more upscale experience.

Most bars close by 1 AM except on New Year's Eve when special permits extend hours. Dress codes are strict - collared shirts for men, no sportswear.

For [food tours](/kolkata/food-tours/) that include Park Street's famous eateries, several operators run evening walks covering multiple restaurants.

## Christmas on Park Street

December transforms Park Street into Kolkata's Christmas capital. Elaborate decorations, carol singers, and midnight mass at St. Paul's Cathedral create a festive atmosphere unmatched in India.

The celebrations peak between December 20-25 when crowds swell to over 100,000 people nightly. Hotels like The Park and The Astor organize special Christmas Eve parties (₹3000-5000/$36-60 per person).

Parking becomes impossible during Christmas week. Take the Metro instead.

## Shopping Options

Park Street's shopping ranges from heritage stores to modern boutiques. Music World stocks the city's best collection of CDs and vinyl records. Oxford Bookstore, one of India's oldest bookshops, occupies a beautiful colonial building.

For serious shopping, head to [Kolkata's best markets](/kolkata/markets-shopping/) which offer better variety and prices than Park Street's tourist-focused stores.

## Park Street Cemetery

The South Park Street Cemetery, established in 1767, houses elaborate tombs of British colonial officials. Entry costs ₹20 ($0.25) for Indians, ₹100 ($1.20) for foreigners. Open 9 AM-5 PM daily except Mondays.

This peaceful spot contrasts sharply with Park Street's commercial energy. The cemetery features some of Kolkata's finest colonial architecture and provides insight into British colonial history. Include it in your [heritage sites](/kolkata/heritage-sites/) exploration.

## Parking and Transportation

Parking on Park Street ranks among Kolkata's biggest challenges. Street parking costs ₹20-30 ($0.25-0.35) per hour when available. Better options include:

- Forum Mall parking: ₹20/hour, 5-minute walk
- Quest Mall: ₹25/hour, 10-minute walk  
- Hotel parking: ₹50-100/day if dining there

Park Street Metro Station (Blue Line) provides the easiest access. Exit at Gate 1 for restaurants, Gate 3 for the cemetery.

Auto-rickshaws charge ₹80-120 ($1-1.50) from major hotels. Uber/Ola costs ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.20) depending on surge pricing.

## Best Times to Visit

Evenings (7-11 PM) offer the full Park Street experience with lit-up restaurants and active street life. Avoid lunch hours when many restaurants close between 3-6 PM.

December brings Christmas magic but also impossible crowds. For a quieter experience, visit January-March when [Kolkata's weather](/kolkata/best-time-visit-kolkata/) remains pleasant.

Weekday evenings offer shorter queues and easier parking compared to Friday-Sunday when local crowds peak.
