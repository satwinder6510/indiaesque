**You can visit Howrah Bridge by walking across from either the Kolkata side (near Barabazar) or Howrah side, taking the metro to Mahatma Gandhi Road or Howrah stations, or enjoying ferry rides underneath for river views.**

The iconic Howrah Bridge stands as Kolkata's most recognizable landmark, connecting the city with Howrah across the Hooghly River. Built between 1936-1943 without a single nut or bolt, this cantilever bridge handles over 100,000 vehicles and 150,000 pedestrians daily.

## Getting to Howrah Bridge

The easiest access point from Kolkata is Strand Road near Barabazar. Take the metro to Mahatma Gandhi Road station (Central Line) and walk 500 meters east. From the Howrah side, exit Howrah Junction railway station and walk 300 meters north to reach the bridge approach.

Auto-rickshaws charge ₹30-50 ($0.35-0.60) from central Kolkata areas like Park Street or New Market. Taxis cost ₹80-120 ($0.95-1.45) depending on traffic and starting point.

For a unique perspective, catch a ferry from Babu Ghat or Fairlie Ghat. These operate every 15-20 minutes from 6 AM to 8 PM, costing ₹5-10 ($0.06-0.12) per person.

## Walking Across the Bridge

Dedicated pedestrian walkways run along both sides of the bridge. The walk takes 10-15 minutes and offers panoramic views of the Hooghly River, ghats, and Kolkata skyline. The walkways are 1.5 meters wide, so stay alert during rush hours (8-10 AM and 6-8 PM).

Private vehicles cannot cross the bridge - only buses, taxis, commercial vehicles, and two-wheelers are permitted. This restriction, implemented in 1965, helps preserve the structure while managing traffic flow.

## Best Photography Spots

The most iconic shots come from the Kolkata side approach road on Strand Road. Position yourself near the flower market for foreground color, especially during early morning when vendors arrange their displays.

From the bridge itself, the east side walkway provides better lighting during sunset hours (5:30-6:30 PM). The west walkway works better for sunrise shots (5:30-6:30 AM) and captures the city skyline.

For elevated perspectives, the nearby Millennium Park offers excellent bridge views, particularly during evening illumination. The park stays open until 8 PM and charges ₹10 ($0.12) entry.

## Mullik Ghat Flower Market Experience

Located directly beneath the bridge's Kolkata approach, Mullik Ghat flower market operates 24 hours but peaks between 4-6 AM. Wholesale traders arrive with truck loads of marigolds, roses, and jasmine from rural Bengal.

Visit during pre-dawn hours to witness the organized chaos - porters carrying massive flower loads, vendors setting up colorful displays, and the sweet fragrance mixing with river breeze. Photography is generally welcomed, but ask permission for close-up shots of vendors.

The market connects directly to [heritage sites in Kolkata](/kolkata/heritage-sites/) like Jagannath Ghat and Armenian Ghat, making it part of a broader walking exploration.

## Ferry Rides and River Views

Several ferry services operate beneath the bridge. The Howrah-Babughat route runs every 15 minutes from 6 AM to 7 PM, costing ₹8 ($0.10) per person. The 5-minute journey provides classic bridge views from water level.

Private boat operators at Armenian Ghat offer 30-minute photography tours for ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) per person. These boats venture further up and downstream for varied perspectives of the bridge's massive steel structure.

During monsoon months (July-September), ferry services occasionally suspend due to high water levels. Check with ghat operators before planning water-based visits.

## Historical Significance

The bridge replaced a pontoon bridge and was originally named New Howrah Bridge. Renamed Rabindra Setu in 1965 after Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, locals still call it Howrah Bridge. The 705-meter span made it the world's third-longest cantilever bridge when completed.

Its construction used 26,500 tons of steel, all transported and assembled without disrupting river traffic below. The bridge withstood Japanese bombing attempts during World War II and cyclones over eight decades.

This engineering marvel connects to Kolkata's broader [heritage exploration](/kolkata/heritage-sites/), linking colonial-era structures with modern transportation networks.

## Evening Illumination

LED lighting systems illuminate the bridge from sunset until midnight. The best viewing spots include Princep Ghat (2 km south), Millennium Park, and the Howrah station approach road. The lighting creates dramatic silhouettes perfect for night photography.

Weekend evenings draw larger crowds, so weekdays offer more space for photography and peaceful viewing. The illumination enhances the bridge's Gothic Revival architectural details, particularly the ornate lamp posts and decorative ironwork.

## Safety and Practical Tips

The bridge can get crowded during festivals and rush hours. Keep valuables secure and maintain awareness of your surroundings. The walkways have railings, but avoid leaning over for photographs.

During monsoons, the walkways become slippery. Wear appropriate footwear and carry umbrellas. Police booths at both ends provide assistance if needed.

The flower market area can be chaotic with trucks and porters moving quickly. Stay alert and follow vendor instructions in congested areas.

## Nearby Attractions

After visiting the bridge, explore the adjacent [markets and shopping areas](/kolkata/markets-shopping/) including Burrabazar and New Market. The Armenian Church and Nakhoda Mosque sit within walking distance on the Kolkata side.

Howrah station, one of India's largest railway terminals, offers architectural interest with its colonial-era design and modern facilities. The station's clock tower provides another photography angle of the bridge area.
