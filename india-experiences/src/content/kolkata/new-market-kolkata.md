**New Market Kolkata, officially called Sir Stuart Hogg Market, is a 150-year-old shopping complex offering everything from spices and clothing to electronics and souvenirs. Located on Lindsay Street near Esplanade Metro Station, it's open daily from 10 AM to 8 PM.**

New Market remains one of Kolkata's most popular shopping destinations for both locals and tourists. The market's Victorian-era architecture houses over 2,000 shops spread across different sections, each specializing in specific products.

## Getting to New Market

Take the Blue Line metro to Esplanade Station - New Market is a 5-minute walk from Exit 2. The iconic red-brick building with its clock tower sits at the intersection of Lindsay Street and Sir Stuart Hogg Street. Buses 8, 12, and 30 also stop nearby at Dharmatala.

Parking is available at the multi-level parking facility on Free School Street, charging ₹20 ($0.25) per hour. Street parking costs ₹10 ($0.12) but spaces fill up quickly after 11 AM.

## Market Sections and What to Buy

### Ground Floor - Food and Spices
The spice section offers aromatic masalas, tea, and dried fruits. Popular purchases include:
- Darjeeling tea: ₹400-800 per kg ($5-10)
- Garam masala: ₹200-400 per kg ($2.50-5)
- Dried fruits and nuts: ₹600-1,200 per kg ($7-15)

The textile section also sells fabric by the meter, with cotton starting at ₹150 ($1.80) and silk at ₹800 ($10) per meter.

### Electronics and Accessories
The electronics section carries both genuine and counterfeit items. Stick to established shops for authentic products:

- Mobile accessories: ₹200-1,500 ($2.50-18)
- Watches: ₹1,000-15,000 ($12-180)

## Bargaining Strategies

Start by offering 50% of the quoted price. Most vendors expect negotiation and initially quote prices 2-3 times higher than their minimum acceptable rate. For items over ₹2,000 ($24), you can typically get 40-50% discounts.

Some shops display "Fixed Price" boards - these usually offer fair rates with minimal room for bargaining. Compare prices across 3-4 shops before making purchases, especially for expensive items.

Cash payments get better deals than cards. Carry small denomination notes as vendors often claim they don't have change for large bills.

## Avoiding Fake Goods

New Market has a reputation for counterfeit branded items, particularly in electronics, perfumes, and designer clothing. Red flags include:

- Prices significantly below market rates
- Poor packaging quality
- Spelling mistakes on labels
- Vendors reluctant to provide receipts

For electronics, buy only from shops that provide proper warranties and receipts. Avoid "branded" perfumes and cosmetics from small stalls - stick to established cosmetics shops.

## Safety Tips

Keep valuables in front pockets or a money belt. The market gets crowded, especially on weekends, making pickpocketing easier. Don't carry expensive jewelry or large amounts of cash.

Some vendors are pushy - be firm but polite when declining. If you feel harassed, head to one of the security posts located at each entrance.

Women shopping alone should avoid the upper floors during late hours. The market is generally safe, but like any busy area in Kolkata, basic precautions help. Read more about [staying safe as a tourist in Kolkata](/kolkata/is-kolkata-safe-for-tourists/).
