**Mother Teresa House, officially called the Motherhouse, is located at 54A, A. J. C. Bose Road in Kolkata's Park Circus area. The house serves as the headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity and contains Mother Teresa's tomb, a small museum, and welcomes visitors daily from 8:00-11:45 AM and 3:00-6:00 PM.**

This simple two-story building attracts thousands of visitors annually who come to pay respects to the Nobel Peace Prize winner who dedicated her life to serving Kolkata's poorest residents. The Motherhouse remains an active convent where the Missionaries of Charity sisters continue Mother Teresa's work.

## Location and Getting There

The Motherhouse sits on A. J. C. Bose Road, formerly known as Lower Circular Road, in the Park Circus neighborhood. From Park Street Metro Station, take a taxi (₹80-120/$1-1.50) or bus route 8B, 8C, or S4 to reach the house in 15-20 minutes. If you're staying in central Kolkata, the journey from New Market or Esplanade area costs ₹100-150 ($1.20-1.80) by taxi.

The building is clearly marked with a small sign reading "Mother House" - don't expect anything grand. The entrance is through a simple wooden door that opens to a small courtyard.

## Visiting Hours and Entry Requirements

The Motherhouse maintains strict visiting schedules:
- **Morning**: 8:00 AM to 11:45 AM
- **Afternoon**: 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM
- **Closed**: Thursday afternoons and Sundays

Entry is completely free, but you must follow the dress code. Wear modest clothing - full-length pants or long skirts, covered shoulders, and closed shoes. Shorts, sleeveless tops, and flip-flops are not permitted. Guards at the entrance will turn you away if you're inappropriately dressed.

Remove your shoes before entering the main prayer room. Maintain complete silence throughout your visit - this is an active place of worship and contemplation.

## Mother Teresa's Tomb

The marble tomb containing Mother Teresa's remains sits in the ground floor prayer room. The simple white marble slab bears the inscription "Love one another as I have loved you" in English and Bengali. Fresh flowers, usually marigolds and roses, are placed daily on the tomb by the sisters.

Visitors often kneel or sit quietly beside the tomb for prayer or reflection. The atmosphere is peaceful and reverent. Many people leave written prayers or intentions in a small box near the tomb.

## Museum and Exhibits

The first floor houses a modest museum displaying Mother Teresa's personal belongings and photographs documenting her life in Kolkata. You'll see her simple wooden bed, worn sandals, the blue-bordered white sari she made famous, and handwritten letters. The museum includes photographs from her early days as a teacher at Loreto Convent to her Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 1979.

Display boards show her work with the dying at Kalighat, the children's homes, and leprosy patients. The museum provides context for understanding her 45 years of service in Kolkata, from 1948 until her death in 1997.

## Photography and Behavior Guidelines

Photography is strictly forbidden inside the Motherhouse. Guards monitor this rule carefully and will ask you to delete photos if caught taking them. You can photograph the exterior of the building from the street.

Maintain silence throughout your visit. The sisters live and work here, and many visitors come for prayer and meditation. Turn off mobile phones or keep them on silent mode. Children should stay close to parents and remain quiet.

Touching or leaning on the tomb is not permitted. View the exhibits respectfully and don't crowd other visitors in the small museum space.

## Volunteer Opportunities

The Missionaries of Charity welcome volunteers who want to serve alongside them. Contact the sisters at the Motherhouse to inquire about volunteer work at their various homes for the dying, orphanages, and centers for people with disabilities around Kolkata.

Most volunteer work involves basic care - feeding patients, helping with hygiene, playing with children, or simple cleaning tasks. No special skills are required, just a willingness to serve. Many international visitors extend their stay in Kolkata specifically to volunteer.

## Nearby Attractions

After visiting the Motherhouse, walk 10 minutes to Kalighat Temple, one of Kolkata's most important religious sites. This ancient temple dedicated to Goddess Kali sits close to Kalighat Metro Station. Mother Teresa established her first home for the dying, Nirmal Hriday, directly adjacent to this temple.
