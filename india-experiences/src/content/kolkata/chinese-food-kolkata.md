**Kolkata serves the best Chinese food in India, with Tangra Chinatown offering authentic Hakka cuisine and Tiretta Bazaar providing traditional breakfast options. Expect to spend ₹150-400 ($1.80-4.80) per dish at established restaurants.**

## Tangra Chinatown: The Heart of Chinese Cuisine

Tangra, located in East Kolkata near the EM Bypass, houses India's only Chinatown and serves the most authentic Chinese food outside of China. The area developed when Chinese immigrants settled here in the 1960s after the India-China war, establishing leather tanneries and restaurants.

**Golden Joy** on Tangra Road stands as the neighborhood's flagship restaurant. Their chili chicken (₹280/$3.40) and sweet and sour pork (₹320/$3.85) represent classic Indo-Chinese fusion at its finest. The restaurant opens at 11:30 AM and stays packed until midnight.

**Beijing Restaurant** on the same stretch serves traditional Hakka dishes rarely found elsewhere in India. Try their steamed fish with black bean sauce (₹450/$5.40) and hand-pulled noodles (₹220/$2.65). Both restaurants accept cards and offer home delivery within 5 km.

You can reach Tangra by taking the Blue Line metro to Kavi Nazrul station and then a 10-minute auto ride (₹40-60/$0.50-0.70).

## Tiretta Bazaar: Morning Chinese Breakfast Culture

Tiretta Bazaar in Central Kolkata transforms into a Chinese breakfast hub every morning from 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM. This 200-year-old market serves the city's oldest Chinese community, descendants of immigrants who arrived in the late 1700s.

Walk down Blackburn Lane to find elderly Chinese aunties selling:
- Fresh dim sum (₹80-120/$1-1.45 for 4 pieces)
- Fish ball soup (₹60/$0.70)
- Steamed pork buns (₹50/$0.60)
- Chinese tea and congee (₹40/$0.50)

The breakfast vendors speak a mix of Hakka, Bengali, and broken Hindi. They prepare everything fresh daily using recipes passed down through generations. Cash only - carry small notes as vendors rarely have change for ₹500 notes.

Take the Green Line metro to Esplanade station - Tiretta Bazaar is a 5-minute walk from Exit 2.

## Famous Restaurants Beyond Tangra

**Eau Chew** in Tangra offers upscale Chinese dining with dishes like Peking duck (₹850/$10.20) and salt and pepper prawns (₹480/$5.75). Make reservations on weekends as this place fills up quickly.

**Mandarin** on Park Street serves excellent Chinese food in the city center. Their honey chili potatoes (₹180/$2.15) and American chopsuey (₹240/$2.90) attract both locals and tourists. Open daily from 12 PM to 11 PM.

**Kim Ling** in New Market specializes in Chinese breakfast and lunch. Their wonton soup (₹120/$1.45) and fried rice (₹160/$1.90) offer good value for money.

## Indo-Chinese Fusion: Kolkata's Unique Contribution

Kolkata created Indo-Chinese cuisine when Chinese cooks adapted their recipes to Indian tastes in the 1950s. Nelson Wang, a Chinese-Indian chef, claims to have invented chicken manchurian at his restaurant in Mumbai, but the fusion style originated in Kolkata's Chinese community.

Popular Indo-Chinese dishes you'll find everywhere:
- Hakka noodles (₹180-250/$2.15-3)
- Chili chicken (₹220-300/$2.65-3.60)
- Fried rice with egg (₹150-200/$1.80-2.40)
- Sweet and sour vegetables (₹160-220/$1.90-2.65)

The [food tours](/kolkata/food-tours/) in Kolkata always include stops at Chinese restaurants, combining this cuisine with Bengali dishes for a complete culinary experience.

## Cultural History of Chinese Community

Kolkata's Chinese population peaked at 20,000 in the 1960s but now numbers around 2,000. The community consists mainly of Hakka Chinese who immigrated for work opportunities. They established three main settlements: Tiretta Bazaar (1780s), Tangra (1960s), and Bow Bazaar (1900s).

Chinese temples dot these areas - visit the Toong On Temple in Tiretta Bazaar or the Sea Ip Temple in Tangra to understand the community's religious practices. Both temples welcome visitors and provide insight into Chinese-Indian cultural fusion.

The community celebrates Chinese New Year with special menus at restaurants and temple festivities. During this time (late January/early February), restaurants offer traditional dishes not available year-round.

## Best Times to Visit and Practical Tips

**Morning (6:30-9:30 AM)**: Visit Tiretta Bazaar for breakfast. The vendors close once they sell out, usually by 10 AM.

**Lunch (12-3 PM)**: Most restaurants offer lunch specials with smaller portions at reduced prices. Expect 15-20% savings compared to dinner prices.

**Evening (7-10 PM)**: Prime time for dinner in Tangra. Restaurants are fully staffed and serve complete menus. Weekend evenings get crowded - arrive by 7:30 PM to avoid waiting.
