**Kolkata offers diverse transport options including the Metro (₹5-20/$0.06-0.24), iconic yellow Ambassador taxis, app-based cabs, buses, historic trams, and auto-rickshaws, with services generally operating until 9:30-10:00 PM.**

Getting around Kolkata becomes straightforward once you understand the city's transport ecosystem. The extensive network connects major attractions, making it easy to explore everything from [heritage sites](heritage-sites/) to local [markets](markets-shopping/) without breaking the bank.

## Kolkata Metro - Your Best Friend

The Kolkata Metro remains your most reliable transport option. At ₹5-20 ($0.06-0.24) per journey, it's incredibly affordable and covers most areas you'll want to visit. The Blue Line runs north-south from Dakshineswar to Kavi Subhash, while the Green Line connects Howrah Maidan to Sector V Salt Lake.

Key stations for tourists:
- **Esplanade**: Central Kolkata, near Park Street
- **Kalighat**: For Kali Temple
- **Rabindra Sarobar**: South Kolkata attractions
- **Chandni Chowk**: New Market area
- **Central**: Near Howrah Bridge

Metro operates 7:00 AM to 9:30 PM on weekdays and 8:30 AM to 9:30 PM on Sundays. Women-only coaches run during rush hours (8:00-11:00 AM and 5:00-8:00 PM) - they're the first coach on most trains.

## Yellow Taxis - The Ambassador Experience

Those yellow Ambassador cars are Kolkata icons. Expect to pay ₹25 ($0.30) for the first kilometer and ₹12-15 for each additional kilometer. Many drivers prefer negotiating fixed rates over using meters, especially for tourists.

Negotiate upfront for destinations like:
- City center to Howrah Station: ₹80-120 ($1-1.50)
- Park Street to Kalighat: ₹60-80 ($0.70-1)
- Any cross-city journey: ₹150-300 ($2-3.50)

## App-Based Rides - Uber and Ola

Uber and Ola operate throughout Kolkata with transparent pricing. They're particularly useful during monsoons when finding street taxis becomes challenging. Expect 10-15% higher fares than yellow taxis, but you get air conditioning and GPS tracking.

Both apps work well, though Ola sometimes has better local driver coverage in outer areas like Salt Lake or Rajarhat.

## City Buses - Complex But Cheap

Kolkata's bus network is extensive but complicated. Government buses (blue and red) charge ₹7-15 ($0.08-0.18) for most routes, while private buses cost ₹5-12 ($0.06-0.15). 

Major bus routes connect:
- **Esplanade to Tollygunge**: Route 213, 214
- **Howrah Bridge to Salt Lake**: Route S1, S2
- **Park Street to Airport**: Route AC-1

Unless you're staying for weeks, stick to Metro and taxis for convenience.

## Historic Trams - Slow But Scenic

Kolkata's trams are the last operating tram system in India. Only a few routes remain active, mainly Esplanade to Tollygunge and Shyambazar to Esplanade. At ₹5-10 ($0.06-0.12), they're cheap and offer unique city views, but expect slow journeys - perfect for photography, not punctuality.

## Auto-Rickshaws - Limited Zones

Auto-rickshaws operate mainly in specific areas like Salt Lake, Rajarhat, and some suburban zones. They're banned in central Kolkata. Where available, expect ₹15-20 ($0.18-0.24) for short distances.

## Airport Transfers

**From Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport:**
- **Prepaid taxi booth**: ₹300-400 ($3.50-5) to city center
- **Uber/Ola**: ₹250-350 ($3-4.20)
- **Airport Express bus**: ₹50 ($0.60) to select locations
- **Metro connection**: Take bus to Dum Dum Metro station (₹15), then Metro to city

The airport is 15-17 km from central Kolkata. Allow 45-60 minutes during peak hours.

## Traffic Patterns and Timing

Rush hours hit hardest 8:00-11:00 AM and 5:00-8:00 PM on weekdays. Avoid traveling during these times unless using Metro. Park Street, Rashbehari Avenue, and Central Avenue see heavy congestion.

Monsoon season (June-September) severely impacts surface transport. Roads flood frequently, making Metro your safest bet during heavy rains.

## Women-Only Transport Options

Beyond Metro's women-only coaches, several buses run ladies-only services during peak hours. Pink auto-rickshaws (where permitted) are driven by women for female passengers. When [planning your Kolkata itinerary](kolkata-travel-tips/), factor in these safer transport options.

Most transport modes connect well with popular areas covered in our [main Kolkata guide](kolkata/), making city exploration straightforward once you understand the basics.
