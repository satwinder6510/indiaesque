faq:
  - question: "What unique experiences can you do in Kolkata?"
    answer: "Top Kolkata experiences include heritage tram rides (₹30), Kumartuli idol-maker visits (free or ₹500-1,000 with guide), Durga Puja pandal tours (September-October), Hooghly River cruises (₹200-500), and walking tours through historic paras (neighbourhoods)."
  - question: "Can you still ride trams in Kolkata?"
    answer: "Yes, Kolkata has India's only remaining tram network. Routes connect Esplanade, College Street, and Shyambazar. Tickets cost ₹5-30. It's a working transport system but also a heritage experience — these are original 1960s-era cars on tracks laid in the 1880s."
  - question: "When is Durga Puja and should I visit then?"
    answer: "Durga Puja falls in September or October (dates vary by lunar calendar). It's the best time to experience Kolkata — the city transforms with elaborate pandals, cultural events, and festivities. However, hotels book up months ahead and prices triple. Book early or avoid if you dislike crowds."

Kolkata offers experiences rooted in living culture rather than tourist constructions. The city's heritage trams, artisan quarters, literary cafes, and festival traditions create moments you won't find elsewhere in India.

This guide covers Kolkata's best experiences beyond the standard monuments. For practical information, see the [Kolkata city guide](/kolkata/).

## Heritage Tram Rides

- Air conditioning: none (windows open)

**Best routes:**
- **Esplanade to Shyambazar:** Through the heart of North Kolkata
- **Esplanade to College Street:** Book market area
- **Howrah route:** Currently discontinued, may restart

**Tickets:** ₹5-30 depending on distance. Buy from conductor.

**Best time:** Early morning or late afternoon. Avoid rush hours.

**Tips:**
- Sit near windows for photography

## Durga Puja Pandal Hopping

Durga Puja (September-October) is Kolkata's defining event — five days when the city transforms into an open-air festival of art, devotion, and celebration. Temporary structures (pandals) house elaborate goddess idols, and the entire city walks from pandal to pandal.

**What to expect:**
- Thousands of pandals across the city
- Elaborate themes — replicas of temples, social commentary, pure artistic expression
- Crowds, food stalls, cultural programs
- 24-hour activity for five days

**Famous pandals:**
- College Square
- Kumortuli Park
- Mohammad Ali Park
- Deshapriya Park
- Bagbazar

**Tips:**
- Book hotels 2-3 months ahead
- Prices triple during Puja
- Late-night pandal hopping (midnight onwards) has smaller crowds
- Hire a local guide for the best pandals

**When:** Dates follow lunar calendar. Check specific dates for your travel year.
