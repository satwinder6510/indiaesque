## Taxis

### Yellow Ambassador Taxis

The iconic yellow Ambassadors are fading but still exist. Metered, relatively honest.

**How it works:**
- Flag down taxi
- Confirm destination
- Meter runs (check it starts)
- Pay fare shown

**Approximate fares:**
- Minimum: ₹30
- Per km: ₹10-12

### Uber and Ola

**Widely available.** Reliable, AC, GPS-tracked.

**Typical fares:**

- Airport to Park Street: ₹400-600
- Across city: ₹200-400

## Auto Rickshaws

Green three-wheelers operate in outer areas. Less common in central Kolkata than in other cities.

**Fares:** Similar to taxis. Negotiate or insist on meter.

---

## Hand-Pulled Rickshaws

Kolkata is the last city with hand-pulled rickshaws. Controversial — some see exploitation, others see livelihoods.

**Where:** North Kolkata narrow lanes
**If you use:** Tip generously. These are among Kolkata's poorest workers.

---

## Ferries

### Hooghly River Ferries

**Cost:** ₹5-10

**Taxi:** 20-40 minutes (₹100-200)

**Taxi/Uber:** 30-45 minutes (₹150-250)
**Best option** — metro doesn't connect directly

---

## During Durga Puja

Transport changes dramatically:

**Roads:** Gridlocked in many areas
**Walking:** Often the only option
