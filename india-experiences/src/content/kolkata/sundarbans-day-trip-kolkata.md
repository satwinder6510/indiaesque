**Sundarbans day trips from Kolkata cost ₹3,000-8,000 ($36-96) and include transport, boat rides, meals, and permits. Book through established operators like Help Tourism or WBTDC, with advance reservations required for forest entry permits.**

The Sundarbans mangrove forest lies 100 kilometers south of Kolkata, making it accessible for day trips despite the 3-4 hour journey each way. You'll depart early morning around 6 AM from locations like Esplanade or Sealdah and return by 8-9 PM.

## Tour Package Options and Pricing

Day trip packages range from ₹3,000-5,500 ($36-66) per person, while 2-day/1-night tours cost ₹6,000-8,000 ($72-96). Budget operators like Backpackers United offer basic day trips for ₹3,200 ($38), while premium packages through Help Tourism cost ₹5,500 ($66) with better meals and smaller group sizes.

Two-day packages include overnight stays at government forest lodges or eco-resorts on Sajnekhali Island. The extra time allows for early morning and evening boat safaris when wildlife is most active.

## Recommended Tour Operators

**West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC)** operates official tours from their Esplanade office. Their day trips cost ₹4,200 ($50) and include AC transport, lunch, and permits. Book at 3/2 BBD Bag East or online.

**Help Tourism** offers well-organized packages for ₹5,500 ($66) with experienced naturalist guides and comfortable vehicles. They pick up from major hotels and provide detailed wildlife information.

**Backpackers United** runs budget-friendly group tours for ₹3,200 ($38). While basic, they're reliable and include all essentials. Book online or from their Park Street office.

Choose operators who handle forest department permits - individual bookings require advance paperwork that's time-consuming for tourists.

## What's Included in Tour Packages

All packages include round-trip AC transport from Kolkata, boat rides through creeks and rivers, forest entry permits, lunch, and guide services. Most tours visit Sajnekhali Watchtower, Sudhanyakhali Watchtower, and Dobanki Canopy Walk.

Meals are typically Bengali fish curry with rice, though some operators offer continental options. Overnight packages include basic accommodation at forest lodges with attached bathrooms and mosquito nets.

Tours don't include personal expenses, camera fees (₹50-100), or tips for boat crews and guides.

## Tiger Sighting Reality

Tiger sightings on day trips are extremely rare. The Sundarbans houses around 100 Royal Bengal Tigers across 2,585 square kilometers, but they're primarily nocturnal and avoid tourist areas. You might spot pugmarks, scratch marks, or hear distant calls, but actual sightings happen maybe once every 50-100 trips.

Focus on other wildlife instead - spotted deer, wild boars, crocodiles, monitor lizards, and over 300 bird species including kingfishers, eagles, and herons are commonly seen.

## Best Time to Visit

October through March offers the ideal weather with temperatures between 15-25°C (59-77°F) and minimal rainfall. December and January are peak months with best wildlife activity and comfortable conditions for boat rides.

Avoid monsoons (June-September) when tours often cancel due to rough waters and heavy rains. Summer months (April-May) are extremely hot and humid with temperatures reaching 40°C (104°F).

The [best time to visit Kolkata](/kolkata/best-time-visit-kolkata/) coincides perfectly with Sundarbans season, allowing you to combine both experiences.

## Departure Points and Logistics

Most tours depart from Kolkata locations like Esplanade, Park Street, or major hotels around 6-7 AM. The drive to Godkhali jetty takes 3-4 hours depending on traffic and stops.

From Godkhali, you'll board motorboats for the 2-3 hour journey into the Sundarbans core area. Some operators use Canning as an alternative departure point, which is slightly closer.

Book at least 3-5 days in advance, especially during peak season (December-February). Weekend trips require even earlier booking due to limited boat capacity and permit restrictions.

## What to Pack and Expect

Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, comfortable walking shoes, and light cotton clothes. Mosquito repellent is essential. Most boats have basic toilet facilities, but carry tissues and hand sanitizer.

Expect long periods on boats with limited shade. The mangrove channels are narrow and winding, offering excellent photography opportunities even without tiger sightings. Local guides share knowledge about mangrove ecology, traditional fishing methods, and conservation efforts.

Tours include village visits where you'll see honey collection, crab fishing, and traditional boat building. These cultural interactions often prove more memorable than wildlife spotting.

Since you're already exploring [things to do in Kolkata](/kolkata/), the Sundarbans trip adds a unique natural dimension to your Bengal experience. Consider your [transport options](/kolkata/kolkata-transport-guide/) for getting to departure points efficiently.
