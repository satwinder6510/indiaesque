Founded by Tagore in 1921, this unique university follows the guru-shishya tradition with classes held under trees. Visit the main campus during weekday mornings (9 AM-12 PM) to see students and teachers in outdoor classrooms. Entry is free, but register at the main gate with your ID.

The Cheena Bhavan (Chinese studies department) and Kala Bhavan (fine arts department) showcase student artwork and host regular exhibitions.

### Tagore Museum and Uttarayan Complex
Located in Tagore's former residence, this museum displays his manuscripts, paintings, and personal belongings. Open 10:30 AM-1 PM and 2-4:30 PM, closed on Wednesdays. Entry costs ₹10 ($0.12) for Indians and ₹100 ($1.20) for foreigners.

The adjacent Uttarayan Complex includes five houses where Tagore lived and worked: Udichi, Shyamali, Punascha, Udayana, and Konark. Each house has specific visiting hours and showcases different aspects of his life.

### Chatimtala and Prayer Hall

## Shopping for Local Handicrafts

### Surul Rajbari
This government emporium, 2km from the main campus, sells authentic Shantiniketan leather goods, pottery, and textiles. Prices are fixed and reasonable - leather bags cost ₹800-2,500 ($10-30), while pottery items range from ₹200-1,000 ($2.40-12).

## Day Trip vs Overnight Stay

### Day Trip Itinerary
- 10:15 AM: Depart Kolkata on Shantiniketan Express
- 1:30 PM: Reach Shantiniketan, have lunch at Khowai or Khoai restaurant
- 2:30-4:30 PM: Visit Tagore Museum and Uttarayan Complex
- 4:45 PM: Return to Bolpur station for 4:35 PM train
- 7:25 PM: Reach Kolkata

This tight schedule covers main attractions but feels rushed.

### Overnight Stay Benefits
Staying overnight lets you attend evening cultural programs, visit Sriniketan village, and explore rural Bengal. Budget guesthouses cost ₹800-1,500 ($10-18) per night, while Visva Bharati Guest House charges ₹2,000-3,500 ($24-42).

## Best Time to Visit

October to March offers ideal weather with clear skies and temperatures between 15-25°C. This period coincides with the university's active season when you can observe regular classes and cultural activities.

Poush Mela (mid-December to early January) is the biggest festival featuring folk music, dance, and crafts. However, crowds can be overwhelming with over 100,000 visitors daily. Hotel prices triple during this period.

Avoid monsoons (June-September) as heavy rains disrupt transportation and outdoor activities. Summer months (April-May) see temperatures reaching 40°C, making sightseeing uncomfortable.
