**October through February is the best time to visit Kolkata, with comfortable temperatures ranging from 15-25°C and minimal rainfall making it ideal for exploring the city's attractions.**

Planning your Kolkata trip around the weather makes all the difference between a comfortable journey and a sweaty struggle through the city's streets. The City of Joy experiences four distinct seasons, each offering different experiences for travelers.

## Winter Season: Peak Travel Time (December-February)

Winter delivers Kolkata's best weather conditions. Temperatures hover between 12-23°C, creating perfect conditions for walking through [heritage sites](//kolkata/heritage-sites/) like Victoria Memorial or exploring the narrow lanes of North Kolkata.

December marks the coolest month with morning temperatures dropping to 12°C, while afternoons remain pleasant at 22°C. January and February see slightly warmer days (15-25°C) but maintain the comfortable, dry conditions that make this season so popular.

Rainfall during winter barely registers at 10-15mm per month, meaning you won't need to pack heavy rain gear. The humidity levels drop to a manageable 60-70%, a welcome relief from the city's typically muggy conditions.

Hotel rates during winter peak at ₹3,000-8,000 ($35-95) per night for mid-range properties. Book accommodations 6-8 weeks in advance, especially for December and January when domestic tourists flock to the city.

## Pre-Winter: Festival Season (October-November)

October and November offer excellent weather with temperatures ranging from 18-28°C. The post-monsoon freshness makes this period particularly appealing, though you'll encounter the year's biggest crowds during Durga Puja (typically September-October).

Durga Puja transforms Kolkata into a cultural showcase, but comes with challenges. Hotel prices skyrocket to ₹5,000-15,000 ($60-180) per night, and availability becomes scarce. The city's population seems to triple as pandal-hoppers crowd every street corner.

If you want to experience Durga Puja, book everything 3-4 months ahead. The festival typically lasts 5 days, but preparations and celebrations extend the busy period to nearly two weeks.

November provides the sweet spot - post-festival calm with excellent weather. You'll find better hotel deals (₹2,500-6,000/$30-70 per night) and can comfortably explore [markets and shopping areas](//kolkata/markets-shopping/) without festival crowds.

## Summer Season: Best Avoided (March-June)

Summer in Kolkata tests even the most heat-tolerant travelers. March starts moderately warm at 25-32°C, but April through June becomes brutal with temperatures reaching 38-40°C.

The real challenge isn't just heat - it's the crushing humidity that reaches 80-90%. This combination makes outdoor sightseeing miserable between 10am-5pm. You'll find yourself jumping between air-conditioned cars, metro trains, and buildings.

Pre-monsoon storms (Kal Baisakhi) in April-May bring brief relief but also flooding in low-lying areas. These storms can dump 50-100mm of rain in a few hours, causing traffic chaos around areas like Sealdah and Howrah.

Summer hotel rates drop to ₹1,800-4,500 ($20-55) per night as tourism slows. If you must visit during summer, plan indoor activities during peak heat hours and carry a good umbrella for sudden storms.

## Monsoon Season: Heavy Rains (June-September)

Kolkata's monsoon brings relief from summer heat but creates new challenges. The Southwest monsoon typically arrives by mid-June, dropping temperatures to 26-32°C but bringing intense humidity and heavy rainfall.

Average monsoon rainfall reaches 1,200-1,500mm, with July and August being the wettest months (300-400mm each). Rain often arrives in heavy bursts that can flood streets within hours, particularly in areas like Central Kolkata and around Howrah Bridge.

The city's drainage system struggles during heavy downpours, creating waterlogged conditions that can trap you indoors for hours. Local trains and buses frequently face delays, affecting your [travel plans around the city](//kolkata/kolkata-transport-guide/).

September sees reducing rainfall (200-250mm) as the retreating monsoon period begins. This can be an interesting time to visit if you don't mind occasional heavy showers and want to see Kolkata's lush, green side.

## Festival Calendar and Crowd Considerations

Beyond weather, Kolkata's festival calendar significantly impacts your visit experience:

**Durga Puja (September-October)**: The city's biggest festival brings massive crowds, higher prices, and booking challenges, but offers unparalleled cultural experiences.

**Kali Puja (October-November)**: Smaller than Durga Puja but still creates local crowds, especially around temples in areas like Kalighat.

**Poila Boishakh (mid-April)**: Bengali New Year brings cultural programs and local celebrations despite the hot weather.

**Christmas and New Year (December-January)**: Popular with domestic tourists, leading to higher hotel rates and crowded attractions like Park Street.

## Planning Your Visit Duration

The ideal Kolkata visit lasts [3-4 days](//kolkata/how-many-days-visit-kolkata/), giving you enough time to explore major attractions without rushing. Winter allows you to pack more outdoor activities into each day, while summer visits require a more relaxed pace with afternoon breaks.

For first-time visitors wanting to experience both historical sites and local culture, plan your trip between November-February when weather conditions allow comfortable exploration of everything from colonial architecture to local food scenes.
