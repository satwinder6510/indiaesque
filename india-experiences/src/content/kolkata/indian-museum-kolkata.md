## Must-See Collections and Galleries

### Egyptian Gallery
The crown jewel remains the 4,000-year-old Egyptian mummy, one of only three complete mummies in India. The gallery displays sarcophagi, canopic jars, papyrus scrolls, and ancient Egyptian jewelry. Spend at least 45 minutes here examining the hieroglyphic inscriptions and burial artifacts.

These sections house the world's largest collection of Buddhist sculptures and relics. The Gandhara sculptures from the 2nd-5th centuries showcase Greco-Buddhist art influences. Look for the massive Buddha statues from Bodhgaya and ancient stupas from various monasteries.

### Natural History Section
The zoology gallery displays massive whale skeletons, preserved specimens of extinct Indian wildlife, and meteorite collections. The 160-year-old banyan tree fossil attracts geology enthusiasts, while the mineral collection includes rare gems from Indian mines.

### Art and Textiles Gallery
Mughal miniature paintings, palm leaf manuscripts, and traditional Indian textiles fill this section. The gallery showcases regional art forms from across India, including Rajasthani paintings and Bengal school artworks.

### Anthropology Section
Tribal artifacts, traditional weapons, folk instruments, and cultural items from India's diverse communities occupy multiple halls. The collection represents over 100 tribal groups and their traditional lifestyles.

### Numismatic Gallery
Ancient coins from various Indian dynasties, British colonial currency, and rare commemorative coins trace India's monetary history. The collection spans 2,500 years of Indian coinage.
