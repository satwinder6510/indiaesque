Kolkata's streets serve up some of India's most diverse and affordable food. You'll taste Bengali traditions alongside Chinese influences that arrived with immigrants over 200 years ago.

## Must-Try Street Food Dishes

### Puchka (₹20-30/$0.24-0.36)

These crispy hollow puris filled with spiced tamarind water are Kolkata's answer to gol gappa. Unlike other cities, Kolkata's puchka uses sweet tamarind water with a hint of black salt. Head to Vivekananda Park or any College Street corner - vendors sell 6-8 pieces for ₹20-30.

### Kathi Rolls (₹40-80/$0.48-0.95)

Born in Kolkata, kathi rolls wrap succulent kebabs in flaky parathas with onions, mint chutney, and lime. Nizam's Restaurant on New Market claims to have invented them in 1932. You'll pay ₹40-60 for chicken rolls, ₹60-80 for mutton versions.

### Jhal Muri (₹10-20/$0.12-0.24)

This spicy puffed rice snack mixes chopped onions, tomatoes, green chilies, mustard oil, and lime juice. Street vendors serve it in newspaper cones. Find the best jhal muri near Gariahat Market or along Park Street - it's the cheapest street food in the city.

### Fish Fry (₹30-50/$0.36-0.60)

Bengali fish fry features fresh fish (usually rohu or hilsa) coated in gram flour batter and deep-fried until golden. Kailashbasi's shop near Gariahat serves exceptional fish fry from 4 PM onwards. Expect to pay ₹30-50 per piece depending on fish size.

### Cutlets (₹15-25/$0.18-0.30)

These deep-fried potato patties stuffed with vegetables or meat come with a tangy mustard sauce. Park Street vendors near the metro station sell fresh cutlets from 5 PM. Vegetable cutlets cost ₹15-20, chicken versions ₹20-25.

## Best Street Food Areas

### New Market

The area around New Market metro station transforms into a food paradise after 4 PM. Try Shaheb Cutlet near the Lindsay Street entrance - they've served perfectly spiced cutlets since 1969. The narrow lanes house dozens of food stalls selling everything from rolls to sweets.

### Park Street

Park Street's sidewalk vendors compete with fancy restaurants by offering quality food at street prices. The stretch between Park Street metro station and Camac Street has the highest concentration of food stalls. Evening hours (6-10 PM) see the best variety.

### College Street

Home to Calcutta University, College Street feeds thousands of students daily. The prices here are the lowest in the city - you'll find jhal muri for ₹10 and tea for ₹5. The area near Coffee House serves traditional Bengali snacks that haven't changed recipes in decades.

### Tiretta Bazaar

Every Sunday morning, Tiretta Bazaar becomes Kolkata's Chinatown breakfast spot. Chinese families who've lived in Kolkata for generations serve authentic dim sum, noodles, and pork dishes. Prices range from ₹30-100 per item. Arrive before 10 AM for the best selection.

**Kim Ling Restaurant** (Tiretta Bazaar) - Sunday morning Chinese breakfast specialist. Pork momos ₹80, chicken noodles ₹70.

## Safety Tips for Street Food

Choose stalls with high customer turnover - busy vendors prepare fresh food constantly. Avoid places where food sits under glass cases for hours. Watch vendors prepare your order when possible.

Drink bottled water instead of tap water or ice. Most vendors offer bottled water for ₹10-20. Skip raw salads and stick to cooked items during your first few days in the city.

Pay attention to cleanliness - vendors who keep their workspace clean usually maintain good food hygiene. Look for stalls where locals eat regularly.

If you're concerned about food safety, consider joining a [food tour in Kolkata](../food-tours/) where guides take you to vetted vendors they trust.

## When to Go

Evening hours (5-9 PM) offer the best variety and freshest food. Many vendors start cooking around 4 PM, so food prepared after this time tastes better. Weekends see larger crowds but also more variety.

Avoid monsoon season (June-September) for outdoor eating unless stalls have proper covers. The best months for street food exploration are October through March when weather allows comfortable outdoor dining.

## Budget Planning

You can eat well for ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) per person if you stick to street food. A typical street food meal might include puchka (₹25), a kathi roll (₹60), and tea (₹10) for ₹95 total.

For a comprehensive food experience covering multiple areas, budget ₹500-800 ($6-9.50) per day. This allows you to try specialties from different neighborhoods and includes transport between locations.
