Kolkata's markets are legendary shopping destinations where you'll find everything from rare antique books to hand-woven silk sarees. The city's four major markets—New Market, College Street, Gariahat, and Hatibagan—each offer distinct experiences and specialties that reflect Bengali culture and commerce.

## New Market (Sir Stuart Hogg Market)

New Market stands as Kolkata's most famous shopping destination, housed in a Victorian Gothic building from 1874. Located near Esplanade Metro station, this covered market spans multiple floors with over 2,000 shops selling textiles, leather goods, jewelry, and souvenirs.

The ground floor specializes in clothing and fabrics. You'll find cotton kurtas starting at ₹300 ($3.60), silk sarees from ₹2,000-₹15,000 ($24-$180), and leather shoes from ₹800-₹3,000 ($9.60-$36). The first floor houses electronics, bags, and accessories, while the basement level sells spices, tea, and food items.

**What to Buy**: Handloom textiles, leather goods, artificial jewelry, perfumes, and Darjeeling tea. The market excels in ready-made garments and fabric by the meter.

**Bargaining Strategy**: Vendors expect negotiation. Start at 40% of the quoted price and settle around 65-70%. For expensive items like silk sarees, you can negotiate more aggressively.

**Best Time to Visit**: Weekday mornings (10 AM-12 PM) are less crowded. Avoid weekends and festival periods when narrow aisles become packed.

**Getting There**: Esplanade Metro station (5-minute walk) or take buses to Esplanade terminus.

## College Street Book Market

College Street hosts the world's largest secondhand book market, stretching along the street near Calcutta University. This academic quarter has been selling books for over 100 years, with permanent shops and sidewalk stalls creating a bibliophile's paradise.

You'll discover rare Bengali literature, vintage English classics, academic textbooks, and political pamphlets. Prices range from ₹20 ($0.24) for paperbacks to ₹2,000 ($24) for rare first editions. Many books cost 60-80% less than their original price.

**Specialties**: Bengali literature, Marxist political texts, university textbooks, rare manuscripts, and vintage magazines. Several shops specialize in specific subjects like medicine, engineering, or humanities.

**Famous Bookstores**: Dasgupta & Co (est. 1886) for rare books, Universal Book Stall for academic texts, and College Street Coffee House area stalls for political literature.

**Operating Hours**: Most shops open 10 AM-9 PM, but street vendors stay until midnight. Sunday mornings offer the best selection as vendors restock over weekends.

**Navigation Tip**: Start from College Street Metro station and walk toward Presidency University. The densest concentration of bookstalls lies between College Square and Harrison Road.

## Gariahat Market

Gariahat Market serves as South Kolkata's primary shopping hub, popular with middle-class Bengali families. Located near Gariahat Metro station, this market combines traditional bazaar atmosphere with modern retail outlets.

The market divides into distinct sections: clothing and accessories on the main road, vegetables and fish in the wet market area, and electronics in the back lanes. Clothing prices start from ₹150 ($1.80) for basic cotton tops, with designer pieces reaching ₹3,000 ($36).

**Local Favorites**: The market excels in everyday wear, especially cotton clothing suitable for Kolkata's humid climate. You'll find excellent selections of salwar kameez, casual shirts, and children's clothing.

**Food Section**: The adjoining fresh market sells the city's freshest fish, vegetables, and spices. Hilsa fish prices vary seasonally from ₹800-₹1,500 per kg ($9.60-$18), while local vegetables cost ₹20-₹80 per kg ($0.24-$0.96).

**Shopping Strategy**: Visit early morning (10-11 AM) for the best selection and cooler temperatures. The market gets extremely crowded after 4 PM when office workers stop for groceries.

**Parking and Access**: Limited street parking available. Metro access makes public transport the preferred option.

## Hatibagan Market

Hatibagan Market operates as North Kolkata's primary shopping destination, particularly famous for affordable clothing and household goods. Located near Shyama Charan Dey Street Metro, this market caters to budget-conscious shoppers seeking good value.

The market's strength lies in wholesale and bulk purchases. Clothing vendors offer significant discounts for buying multiple pieces—₹200 ($2.40) shirts drop to ₹150 ($1.80) when buying three or more.

**Specialty Items**: Children's clothing, traditional Bengali religious items, household utensils, and seasonal goods. During Durga Puja season, the market becomes headquarters for festival shopping.

**Bargaining Culture**: Vendors here expect serious negotiation. Don't hesitate to walk away—sellers often call you back with better prices. Cash payments sometimes earn additional discounts of 5-10%.

**Local Character**: This market maintains traditional Bengali shopping culture. Vendors know regular customers personally and offer special prices to familiar faces.

## Essential Shopping Tips for Kolkata Markets

**Bargaining Fundamentals**: Never accept the first price. Even if an item seems reasonably priced, negotiate for the cultural experience. Vendors respect customers who bargain respectfully but firmly.

**Payment Methods**: Cash remains king in all markets. ATMs are available near major markets, but carry sufficient cash as card payments are limited to larger shops.

**Carrying Bags**: Bring your own shopping bags. Environmental regulations have reduced plastic bag availability, and carrying your own bags makes vendors more willing to negotiate.

**Language Advantage**: Learning basic Bengali numbers helps in negotiations. Vendors appreciate the effort and sometimes offer better prices to tourists who attempt local language.

## Safety and Practical Considerations

**Crowd Management**: All major markets get extremely crowded during peak hours (2-6 PM) and weekends. Plan visits during off-peak times for comfortable shopping experiences.

**Pickpocket Prevention**: Keep valuables secure and avoid displaying large amounts of cash. Money belts work well in crowded market environments. [Is Kolkata safe for tourists?](/kolkata/is-kolkata-safe-for-tourists/) provides detailed safety guidance.

**Weather Considerations**: Summer months (April-June) make market shopping challenging due to heat and humidity. Early morning visits are essential during this period.

**Health Precautions**: Stay hydrated and take breaks in air-conditioned shops or cafes. Several markets have small restaurants where you can rest and refresh.

## Transportation and Getting Around

**Metro Connectivity**: All major markets connect to Kolkata Metro, making public transport the most efficient option. Purchase a metro card for convenient travel between markets.

**Auto-Rickshaw Tips**: Negotiate fares before starting your journey. Short distances between markets typically cost ₹50-₹100 ($0.60-$1.20).

**Walking Routes**: College Street and New Market are within walking distance of each other (15 minutes). Plan to visit both in a single trip.
