faq:
  - question: "What are the best day trips from Kolkata?"
    answer: "Top day trips include Shantiniketan (Tagore's university, 2.5-3 hours), Sundarbans edge (mangrove forest, 3-4 hours to entry), Bishnupur (terracotta temples, 4 hours), and Chandannagar (French heritage, 1.5 hours). The Sundarbans properly requires 2-3 days."
  - question: "Can you do Sundarbans as a day trip from Kolkata?"
    answer: "Only the outer edges. The true Sundarbans experience (tiger reserve, remote waterways) requires 2-3 days. Day trips from Kolkata reach Sundarbans entry points and offer boat rides, but you won't see deep forest or wildlife. For a real Sundarbans experience, book an overnight trip."
  - question: "How do I get to Shantiniketan from Kolkata?"
    answer: "By train: Shantiniketan Express from Howrah (2.5-3 hours, ₹100-300). By car: 3-4 hours via NH 2. Train is more convenient. Return trains leave late afternoon. The town is best explored by cycle-rickshaw."

## Shantiniketan — Tagore's Creative Haven

**Distance:** 165 km north | **Travel time:** 2.5-3 hours by train, 3-4 hours by road | **Best for:** Tagore admirers, art lovers, peaceful escapes

Shantiniketan is the town that grew around Rabindranath Tagore's experimental university, Visva-Bharati. It remains a center for Bengali arts, music, and education — a place where classes are held under trees and the pace is deliberately slow.

### Getting There

**By train (recommended):**
- **Shantiniketan Express:** Departs Howrah around 9:50 AM, arrives Bolpur (Shantiniketan) around 12:30 PM
- **Return:** Leaves around 5:00 PM, reaches Howrah around 7:30 PM
- **Cost:** ₹100-300 ($1.20-3.60) depending on class

**By car:**
- 3-4 hours via NH 2
- Hire car with driver: ₹3,500-5,000 ($42-60) round trip
- Useful if you want flexibility or are a group

### What To See

**Visva-Bharati University:**
- Tagore's museum and home (Uttarayan)
- Kala Bhavana (art college)
- Open-air classes (if session is running)

**Sonajhuri Forest:**
- Sal forest on outskirts
- Saturday haat (market) — crafts, music, local food
- Baul musicians perform

**Nearby villages:**
- Khoai — red laterite landscape
- Local artisan workshops

### Timing

- Visit on **Saturday** for Sonajhuri haat
- **December-February** for pleasant weather and university session
- **Poush Mela (late December)** is the big festival — incredible but crowded

## Sundarbans — The Mangrove Delta

**Distance:** 110 km south | **Travel time:** 3-4 hours to entry points | **Best for:** Nature lovers, wildlife enthusiasts, adventure

The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, shared between India and Bangladesh. It's also home to the Royal Bengal Tiger — though spotting one requires luck and deeper forest access.

### Day Trip Reality Check

A true Sundarbans experience requires 2-3 days. Day trips from Kolkata reach the forest's edge — you'll see mangroves, possibly deer and crocodiles, and get a taste of the ecosystem. You won't see tigers or reach remote areas.

### Day Trip Option

**What's included:**
- Drive to Sonakhali or Godhkhali (3-4 hours)
- Boat ride through outer waterways (2-3 hours)
- Lunch at a village or on boat
- Return by evening

**Cost:** ₹2,500-4,000 ($30-48) per person with operator

**What you'll see:**
- Mangrove channels
- Watchtowers
- Deer, crocodiles, bird species (with luck)
- Village life on the delta edge

### Overnight Recommended

For wildlife sighting chances and deeper forest access:
- 2-night tours reach Sajnekhali, Sudhanyakhali
- Tiger sightings are rare but possible
- Cost: ₹6,000-15,000 ($72-180) depending on comfort level
