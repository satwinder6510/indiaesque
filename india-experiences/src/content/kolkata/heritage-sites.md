## Practical Heritage Site Tips

**Photography Equipment:**
Bring wide-angle lenses for architectural photography. Tripods require special permission at most sites. External flash units are prohibited inside all heritage buildings.

**Dress Code:**
Cover shoulders and knees at religious heritage sites. Comfortable walking shoes are essential for cobblestone areas in North Kolkata.

**Safety Considerations:**
[Kolkata is generally safe for tourists](/kolkata/is-kolkata-safe-for-tourists/), but heritage areas can have narrow lanes. Stick to main routes after dark and keep valuables secure.

**Local Transport:**
