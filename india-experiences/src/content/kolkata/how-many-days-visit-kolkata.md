**You need 3-5 days for a comprehensive Kolkata visit. One day covers major highlights, 2-3 days include heritage and culture, while 4-5 days allow for food tours, markets, and day trips to places like Dakshineswar.**

The City of Joy rewards travelers who take time to understand its layers. While you can tick off famous monuments in a day, Kolkata's real charm lies in its food culture, literary heritage, and neighborhood character that takes days to appreciate.

## 1 Day in Kolkata: The Essentials

If you have just one day, focus on South Kolkata's colonial core. Start at Victoria Memorial (₹30 for Indians, ₹500 for foreigners) by 9 AM when crowds are lighter. Walk through the adjacent Maidan to see the Race Course and Fort William from outside.

Take the metro from Rabindra Sarovar to Chandni Chowk (₹6) and walk to Howrah Bridge via Strand Road. Cross the bridge on foot for photos, then return via Howrah Station.

End at Park Street for lunch at Mocambo or Peter Cat (₹800-1,200 per person). If time permits, visit St. Paul's Cathedral nearby.

This itinerary covers Kolkata's most photographed spots but barely scratches the surface of what makes the city special.

## 2-3 Days: Heritage and Culture

Two to three days let you dig into Kolkata's cultural depth. Add these to your Day 1 itinerary:

**Day 2**: Start in North Kolkata at Jorasanko Thakur Bari (₹15), Rabindranath Tagore's ancestral home. Walk through the narrow lanes to Marble Palace (free but requires permission). Visit Kumartuli potter's quarter to see artisans crafting clay idols.

Take a hand-pulled rickshaw ride through Burrabazar (₹50-100). End at College Street, the world's largest second-hand book market, and grab coffee at Indian Coffee House (₹40-80).

**Day 3**: Explore South Kolkata's [heritage sites](/kolkata/heritage-sites/) like Indian Museum (₹20) and St. John's Church. Visit Kalighat Temple (free) and browse the surrounding market. Take an evening walk along the Hooghly River at Princep Ghat.

## 4-5 Days: Deep Dive Experience

Four to five days transform your visit from sightseeing to experiencing Kolkata like a local.

**Day 4**: Take a proper [food tour](/kolkata/food-tours/) (₹1,500-3,000) covering street food in areas like Shyama Charan Dey Street and Vivekananda Road. Alternatively, explore [markets](/kolkata/markets-shopping/) like New Market for shopping and Gariahat Market for local goods.

Visit the South Park Street Cemetery, one of the world's largest non-church cemeteries, to understand colonial history beyond the monuments.

**Day 5**: Take a day trip to Dakshineswar Temple and Belur Math (₹100 round trip by local train). These spiritual sites on the Hooghly River offer insight into Bengali religious traditions and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda philosophy.

Alternatively, spend the day in Kumartuli and Sovabazar to see traditional crafts and old Kolkata architecture that most tourists miss.

## 6-7 Days: Extended Exploration

**Day 6-7 Options**:

## Tips for Extending Your Stay

Kolkata grows on you gradually. If you find yourself extending your stay, focus on neighborhoods rather than monuments. Spend mornings in different areas like Ballygunge, Shyambazar, or Jadavpur to understand how modern Kolkata lives.

Consider timing your visit during Durga Puja (September-October) or Poila Boishakh (April) when the city transforms completely. These festivals require no additional days but change everything you'll experience.

The metro system (₹5-15 per ride) makes getting around easy, while app-based cabs cost ₹100-300 for most cross-city trips. Check out our [transport guide](/kolkata/kolkata-transport-guide/) for detailed getting around information.

Budget ₹1,500-3,000 per day including accommodation, food, and local transport for a comfortable experience covering all major attractions and food experiences.
