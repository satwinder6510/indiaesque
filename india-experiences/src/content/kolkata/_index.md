## Essential Travel Tips

**Dress code:** Kolkata is relatively liberal, but modest clothing is appreciated, especially when visiting temples. Cotton clothing works best in the humid climate.

**Bargaining:** Expected in markets, with street vendors, and for taxi rides. Start negotiations at 30-40% of the initial quote. Fixed-price shops display "Fixed Price" signs clearly.

**Power cuts:** Occasional power outages occur, especially during summer. Most hotels have backup generators, but carry a portable phone charger.
