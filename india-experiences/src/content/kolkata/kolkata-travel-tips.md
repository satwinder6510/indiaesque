**Navigating Kolkata requires understanding local customs, currency (Indian Rupee), and practical considerations like temple dress codes, market bargaining, and monsoon timing to make your visit smooth and respectful.**

## Currency and Money Matters

The Indian Rupee (INR) is Kolkata's currency. ATMs are everywhere - find reliable ones at Axis Bank, HDFC, and SBI branches on Park Street, Camac Street, and near New Market. Most ATMs dispense ₹500 and ₹200 notes, with daily withdrawal limits of ₹10,000-25,000 ($120-300).

Carry small notes for street food, auto-rickshaws, and temple offerings. Many vendors don't have change for ₹500 notes. Exchange money at authorized dealers near Esplanade Metro Station or BBD Bagh - avoid street exchangers offering "better rates."

Credit cards work at malls, upscale restaurants, and hotels, but cash rules at local markets, street stalls, and heritage sites. Keep ₹2,000-3,000 ($24-36) in small denominations for daily expenses.

## Language Landscape

Bengali dominates daily conversation, but don't worry - Hindi and English get you around easily. Metro announcements, street signs, and restaurant menus display English alongside Bengali. Taxi drivers near Howrah Station and Sealdah understand basic English directions.

Learn these Bengali phrases: "Dhanyabad" (thank you), "Koto taka?" (how much?), and "Ektu kom korben?" (can you reduce the price?). Locals appreciate the effort, especially when [bargaining in Kolkata's markets](/kolkata/markets-shopping/).

## Temple Etiquette and Dress Codes

Temples require modest clothing - cover shoulders, chest, and knees. At Kalighat Temple, remove leather belts, shoes, and bags before the inner sanctum. Dakshineswar Kali Temple has similar restrictions but allows phones for photography in outer areas.

Women should carry scarves for head covering at conservative temples. Men can wear long pants and shirts - shorts aren't acceptable. Don't point your feet toward deities when sitting, and follow the clockwise walking pattern around shrines.

Photography rules vary - Kalighat prohibits cameras inside, while Birla Mandir allows photos in courtyards. Ask priests or security guards before clicking.

## Market Bargaining Strategies

Start negotiations at 30-40% of the quoted price at New Market, Gariahat Market, and College Street. Vendors expect haggling - paying the first price actually offends them. Compare prices at 2-3 stalls before buying.

Fixed-price shops display "No Bargaining" signs - respect these. Government emporiums on Chowringhee Road have set prices but offer authentic products. Street vendors near Esplanade accept 50-60% price cuts, especially after 6 PM.

Cash payments get better discounts than cards. Bundle purchases for lower per-item costs - buying multiple kurtas or books reduces individual prices.

## Food Safety Guidelines

Street food safety depends on turnover - choose stalls with long queues and quick consumption. Puchka (golgappa) vendors near College Street and Gariahat serve fresh items hourly. Avoid pre-cut fruits exposed to air and flies.

Drink bottled water or carry purification tablets. Restaurants on Park Street and Camac Street maintain higher hygiene standards. When trying [Kolkata's famous food tours](/kolkata/food-tours/), start with cooked items before raw salads or chutneys.

Ice cream from branded parlors like Balaram Mullick or K.C. Das is safe, but avoid roadside ice vendors using questionable water sources.

## Weather and Timing Considerations

Skip June through September - monsoon flooding makes travel difficult and many [heritage sites](/kolkata/heritage-sites/) close during heavy rains. October through March offers pleasant weather for walking tours and outdoor exploration.

Summer temperatures (April-May) reach 40°C (104°F) with high humidity. Plan indoor activities like museums and shopping malls during 11 AM-4 PM peak heat hours.

## Heritage Walk Permits and Bookings

Book heritage walks through West Bengal Tourism at BBD Bagh or online 2-3 days ahead. Popular walks like "Colonial Calcutta" and "Kumortuli Pottery Quarter" cost ₹300-500 ($3.60-6.00) per person and fill up quickly during tourist season (November-February).

Private heritage walks require permits for certain areas like Writers' Building vicinity. Tour operators handle paperwork, but individual travelers need prior approval from Kolkata Police tourist cell near Lalbazar.

## Photography Restrictions

Metro stations prohibit photography for security reasons - guards strictly enforce this rule. Government buildings around BBD Bagh, including GPO and High Court, don't allow cameras without special permits.

Religious sites have varying policies - always ask before photographing people or ceremonies. Street photography is generally acceptable, but respect privacy and avoid photographing people without permission.

## Cultural Etiquette

Remove shoes when entering homes or touching someone's feet as respect. Use your right hand for eating, greeting, and giving money - the left hand is considered unclean. Don't touch books, musical instruments, or religious items with feet.

Address older people as "Dada" (elder brother) or "Didi" (elder sister) to show respect. Bengalis value intellectual conversation - discussing literature, films, or politics earns appreciation.

## Tipping Practices

Restaurant tipping follows 10-15% standards if service charges aren't included. Round up taxi fares by ₹20-50 ($0.25-0.60) or pay exact meter amounts - both are acceptable. Hotel staff expect ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) for room service or luggage help.

Tour guides deserve ₹200-500 ($2.40-6.00) daily depending on group size and service quality. Temple pandas (priests) who explain rituals appreciate ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) donations.

## Local Customs and Social Norms

Bengalis eat late - lunch happens around 2 PM, dinner after 9 PM. Don't plan meetings during 1-2 PM siesta time or after 8 PM family hours. Punctuality isn't strict, but foreign visitors should arrive on time for bookings.

Public displays of affection are uncommon - holding hands is acceptable, but kissing draws unwanted attention. Same-sex friendships involve more physical contact than Western norms - don't misinterpret friendly arm-linking or hand-holding.
