Kolkata's nightlife is different from Mumbai or Delhi — less about clubs and more about conversations, live music, and late-night food. Park Street remains the social hub, but the scene has expanded to rooftop bars, microbreweries, and heritage pubs. The city sleeps earlier, but there's charm in its pace.
