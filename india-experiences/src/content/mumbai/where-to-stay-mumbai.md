## Transport Considerations

Mumbai's local trains are the fastest way to travel during peak hours. The [Mumbai transport guide](/mumbai/transport/) explains the three main lines: Western, Central, and Harbor.

If you're planning to explore [markets in Mumbai](/mumbai/markets/) or take [food tours in Mumbai](/mumbai/food-tours/), staying in South Mumbai (Colaba or Marine Drive) saves significant travel time.

Taxis and ride-sharing apps work well, but traffic can be heavy between 8-11 AM and 6-9 PM. Budget extra time for airport transfers during these hours.

## Safety Considerations

All these neighborhoods are generally safe for tourists. Mumbai has a good safety record, but like any major city, stay alert at night. For detailed safety information, check our guide on [is Mumbai safe for tourists](/mumbai/is-mumbai-safe-for-tourists/).

## Booking Tips

Book accommodations well in advance during peak season (November-February). Monsoon season (June-September) offers lower rates but expect heavy rain.

Many hotels offer airport transfers, which is helpful given Mumbai's traffic. Confirm this service when booking, especially if you're arriving late at night.
