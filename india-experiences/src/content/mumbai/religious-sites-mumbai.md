**Mumbai houses significant religious sites representing all major faiths - from the famous Siddhivinayak Temple and Haji Ali Dargah to Mount Mary Church and ancient Buddhist caves at Elephanta, each requiring specific visiting etiquette and offering unique spiritual experiences.**

Mumbai's religious landscape reflects the city's multicultural identity, with sacred sites serving millions of devotees and curious visitors year-round. You'll find everything from 1,000-year-old rock-cut caves to colonial-era churches within the city limits.

## Major Hindu Temples

### Siddhivinayak Temple, Prabhadevi
This 18th-century Ganesha temple attracts over 100,000 visitors daily. The wooden idol faces east, and you'll notice the unique trunk curving to the right - rare among Ganesha statues. Free entry, but expect 2-3 hour queues on Tuesdays. VIP darshan costs ₹101 ($1.20) and reduces wait time significantly.

**Location**: S.K. Bole Road, Prabhadevi  
**Nearest Station**: Prabhadevi (Western Railway)  
**Hours**: 5:30 AM - 11:40 PM

### Mahalaxmi Temple
Dedicated to the goddess of wealth, this 18th-century temple sits near Mahalaxmi Racecourse. The temple houses three goddesses - Mahalaxmi, Mahakali, and Mahasaraswati. Friday evenings see the heaviest crowds. The temple offers free meals (prasad) to all visitors.

**Location**: Bhulabhai Desai Road, Mahalaxmi  
**Nearest Station**: Mahalaxmi (Western Railway)

### Mumbadevi Temple
The city's namesake temple dedicated to the patron goddess Mumbai Devi (Mumbadevi). Located in the crowded Zaveri Bazaar area, this ancient temple predates British colonial rule. Visit early morning to avoid crowds from the surrounding jewelry market.

## Islamic Sites

### Haji Ali Dargah
Mumbai's most photographed religious site sits on a rocky outcrop connected by a 500-meter causeway. The shrine contains the tomb of Sufi saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. You can only visit during low tide when the causeway remains accessible - high tide submerges the pathway completely.

**Entry**: Free  
**Location**: Off Worli coast  
**Timing**: Check tide charts before visiting

### Makhdoom Ali Mahimi Dargah, Mahim
This 15th-century Sufi shrine attracts devotees seeking blessings for health and prosperity. Located near Mahim Creek, the dargah becomes particularly crowded during Thursday evening prayers. The adjoining cemetery contains graves dating back 500 years.

## Christian Churches

### Mount Mary Church, Bandra
Officially called the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, this hilltop church offers panoramic views of the Arabian Sea. The annual Bandra Fair (September) draws over 2 million visitors. The original statue, brought by Portuguese sailors, was replaced after damage - locals believe the new statue performs miracles.

**Location**: Mount Mary Road, Bandra West  
**Nearest Station**: Bandra (Western Railway)

### St. Thomas Cathedral, Fort
