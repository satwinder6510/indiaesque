**Juhu Beach is Mumbai's most famous 6-kilometer stretch of coastline in the western suburbs, known for spectacular sunsets, celebrity spotting, street food stalls, and proximity to Bollywood stars' homes, though swimming is not recommended due to pollution.**

This beach attracts millions of visitors annually who come for evening strolls, street food, and the chance to spot film celebrities at nearby restaurants and hotels. Located in Juhu, about 20 kilometers north of South Mumbai, the beach offers a different vibe from the city center's chaos.

## Getting to Juhu Beach

The journey from Mumbai's city center takes 1-2 hours depending on traffic and your chosen transport method. By road, take the Western Express Highway through Bandra and Santacruz. Expect heavy traffic during peak hours (8-11 AM and 6-9 PM).

For public transport, board a Western Line local train from Churchgate or Mumbai Central to Vile Parle station. From there, take an auto-rickshaw for ₹50-80 ($0.60-1) or bus number 222, 224, or 255 for ₹15-25 ($0.20-0.30). The entire journey costs ₹20-100 ($0.25-1.25) depending on your mode.

Taxis from South Mumbai charge ₹800-1,200 ($10-15) depending on traffic, while app-based cabs like Ola and Uber cost ₹600-1,000 ($7-12). Check our [Mumbai Transport Guide](/mumbai/transport/) for detailed public transport information.

## What to Expect at Juhu Beach

The 6-kilometer shoreline gets crowded after 4 PM when locals arrive for evening walks and street food. Peak hours are 6-8 PM during sunset when hundreds gather for photos and relaxation.

Water activities are extremely limited due to pollution and strong undercurrents. The Arabian Sea here is not suitable for swimming, surfing, or water sports. Instead, focus on the beach's other attractions: people-watching, horse rides (₹100-200 for 10 minutes), and camel rides (₹150-300 for 15 minutes).

## Street Food Scene

Juhu's food stalls are legendary among Mumbai locals. The bhel puri here is considered among the city's best, priced at ₹30-50 ($0.40-0.60) per plate. Other popular items include:

- Pav bhaji: ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.25)
- Vada pav: ₹20-30 ($0.25-0.40)
- Kulfi: ₹40-60 ($0.50-0.75)
- Fresh coconut water: ₹30-50 ($0.40-0.60)
- Corn on the cob: ₹30-50 ($0.40-0.60)

Stalls operate from 4 PM to 11 PM daily. The food is generally safe, but choose busy stalls with high turnover for freshness. Consider joining one of Mumbai's [food tours](/mumbai/food-tours/) that include Juhu Beach stops.

## Celebrity Spotting and Film Industry Connections

Juhu houses many Bollywood celebrities including Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan, and Amitabh Bachchan. Their bungalows line the beach road, though security prevents close access. 

Celebrity spotting happens mainly at upscale restaurants like Saffron Spice (JW Marriott) and The Leela Mumbai. Film shoots occasionally take place on the beach early mornings (6-9 AM) or late evenings after 9 PM.

## ISKCON Temple Nearby

The ISKCON temple in Juhu stands just 2 kilometers from the beach main area. This spiritual center offers free vegetarian meals, cultural programs, and temple tours daily from 4:30 AM to 9 PM. Auto-rickshaws charge ₹40-60 ($0.50-0.75) between the beach and temple.

The temple's restaurant serves authentic South Indian and Gujarati thalis for ₹150-300 ($2-4) in air-conditioned comfort.

## Accommodation Options

Juhu offers accommodation ranging from budget guesthouses to luxury beach resorts. The JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu and The Leela Mumbai provide five-star beachfront experiences starting at ₹15,000-25,000 ($180-300) per night.

Mid-range hotels like Ramada Plaza Palm Grove cost ₹6,000-10,000 ($75-125) nightly, while budget options near the beach start at ₹2,000-4,000 ($25-50). Book accommodations near Juhu Tara Road for easy beach access.

## Best Time to Visit

November through February offers the most pleasant weather for beach visits, with temperatures between 20-30°C (68-86°F). Monsoon season (June-September) brings heavy rains making beach activities difficult.

Visit between 5-7 PM for optimal sunset viewing and cooler temperatures. Weekends get extremely crowded, so weekday evenings offer a more relaxed experience. Our [best time to visit Mumbai](/mumbai/best-time-visit-mumbai/) guide covers seasonal considerations in detail.

## Safety and Practical Tips

Juhu Beach is generally safe for tourists, especially during daylight and early evening hours. However, avoid swimming due to pollution and dangerous currents. Lifeguards are not regularly present.

Keep valuables secure as pickpocketing occurs in crowded areas. Women traveling alone should stick to well-lit, populated sections after dark. The beach area is well-patrolled by police during peak hours.

Bring cash as most food vendors don't accept cards. ATMs are available along Juhu Tara Road and near the ISKCON temple.
