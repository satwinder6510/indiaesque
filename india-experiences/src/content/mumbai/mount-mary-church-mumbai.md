**Mount Mary Church in Bandra is a 16th-century Portuguese basilica famous for miraculous healing, spectacular Arabian Sea views, and hosting Mumbai's largest religious fair each September. Located on a hilltop in Bandra West, this Catholic pilgrimage site welcomes over 50,000 visitors weekly.**

The church stands as one of Mumbai's most significant religious landmarks, drawing devotees from across India regardless of their faith. Built by Portuguese colonists around 1570, the current structure dates to 1904 after the original wooden church was reconstructed in stone.

## History and Architecture

Portuguese sailors established the original Mount Mary Church after they survived a shipwreck and attributed their rescue to the Virgin Mary. The current neo-Gothic structure replaced the earlier building, featuring twin spires that rise 80 feet above the Arabian Sea coastline.

The church houses a statue of the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus, carved from teak wood and brought from Portugal in the 16th century. Local legend claims the statue was found floating in the sea by fishermen, though historical records suggest it arrived with Portuguese missionaries.

Inside, stained glass windows depict biblical scenes, while marble plaques line the walls with thanksgiving messages from devotees who credit the Virgin Mary with healing serious illnesses, finding employment, and resolving family problems.

## The Famous Bandra Fair

Every September, Mount Mary Church transforms into the epicenter of Mumbai's biggest religious celebration. The Bandra Fair runs for eight consecutive days starting the Sunday after September 8th, commemorating the Feast of the Nativity of Mary.

Over two million people attend the fair annually, creating a carnival atmosphere with hundreds of food stalls, game booths, and souvenir shops lining the approach roads. Street vendors sell everything from sugarcane juice (₹30-50 or $0.40-0.60) to pani puri (₹40-60 or $0.50-0.70).

The fair's highlight is the massive procession on September 8th, when thousands of pilgrims climb the 79 steps to the church on their knees as penance or thanksgiving. Police deploy over 1,000 officers to manage the crowds during fair week.
