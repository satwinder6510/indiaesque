**Mumbai operates on Indian Rupees (INR), with widespread UPI digital payments, abundant ATMs, and daily budgets ranging from ₹2,000 ($24) for budget travel to ₹8,000 ($96) for luxury experiences.**

## Indian Rupee: The Local Currency

The Indian Rupee (INR) is Mumbai's official currency. Notes come in denominations of ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, and ₹2,000. Coins are available in ₹1, ₹2, ₹5, and ₹10. You'll rarely see ₹2,000 notes in circulation due to banking restrictions.

Exchange rates fluctuate daily, but expect around ₹83-85 per USD. Major hotels display current rates at reception, and you can check live rates on Google before exchanging money.

## ATMs and Banking

Mumbai has excellent ATM coverage with machines every few blocks in commercial areas. HDFC, ICICI, SBI, and Axis Bank ATMs are everywhere in areas like Bandra, Colaba, and Fort.

**ATM withdrawal limits and charges:**
- Daily limit: ₹10,000-25,000 depending on your bank
- International card fees: ₹100-150 per transaction plus 2-3% foreign exchange markup
- HDFC and ICICI ATMs work reliably with international cards

Avoid standalone ATMs in small shops. Stick to bank-operated machines for security.

## Currency Exchange Options

**Airport exchange counters** at Chhatrapati Shivaji International offer convenience but poor rates. You'll get ₹1-2 less per dollar compared to city rates.

**City exchange options offer better value:**
- **Thomas Cook**: Multiple branches in Fort, Bandra, and Andheri with competitive rates
- **UAE Exchange**: Locations near major hotels and business districts
- **Authorized dealers**: Look for Reserve Bank of India licenses displayed prominently

Banks like HDFC and ICICI also exchange currency but require more documentation and time.

## Digital Payments: UPI Revolution

Mumbai embraces digital payments more than most Indian cities. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) systems like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm are accepted everywhere from street vendors to luxury restaurants.

**Where UPI works:**
- Street food stalls and vendors
- Local trains and metro stations
- Taxis, Uber, and auto-rickshaws
- Markets and shopping centers
- Restaurants and cafes

International visitors can use UPI by downloading apps and linking international cards, though cash remains essential as backup.

## Credit and Debit Card Acceptance

Most establishments in tourist areas accept cards. Visa and Mastercard work widely; American Express has limited acceptance.

**Card-friendly locations:**
- Hotels and restaurants in Colaba, Bandra, and Juhu
- Shopping malls like Palladium and Phoenix
- Department stores and branded shops
- Tourist attractions with entry fees

Street food vendors, local [markets](/mumbai/markets/), and traditional shops prefer cash or UPI.

## Daily Budget Planning

Your daily spending depends on travel style and preferences:

**Budget travel (₹2,000-3,500 / $24-42):**
- Street food meals: ₹200-400
- Local transport: ₹200-300
- Basic attractions: ₹500-800
- Miscellaneous: ₹500

**Mid-range travel (₹4,000-6,000 / $48-72):**
- Restaurant meals: ₹800-1,200
- Taxis and convenience: ₹600-800
- Paid attractions and tours: ₹1,000-1,500
- Shopping and extras: ₹1,000

**Luxury travel (₹8,000+ / $96+):**
- Fine dining experiences: ₹2,000-4,000
- Private transport: ₹1,500-2,500
- Premium experiences: ₹2,000-3,000
- Shopping and entertainment: ₹2,500+

## Tipping Culture in Mumbai

Tipping is customary but not mandatory. Here's what locals expect:

**Restaurants:** 10% for good service at sit-down restaurants. No tips needed at casual eateries or street food stalls.

**Hotels:** ₹50-100 for bellboys, ₹100-200 for room service, ₹200-500 for concierge assistance.

**Taxis and drivers:** Round up the fare or add ₹20-50 for good service. Uber and Ola have in-app tipping options.

**Tour guides:** ₹300-500 per day for [heritage walks](/mumbai/heritage-walks/) or [food tours](/mumbai/food-tours/).

## Money Safety Tips

Keep cash distributed across multiple pockets and bags. Mumbai is generally safe, but pickpocketing occurs in crowded trains and markets.

Use hotel safes for excess cash and backup cards. Carry photocopies of important cards and keep originals secure.

When using ATMs, choose well-lit locations inside banks or shopping centers rather than standalone machines on quiet streets.
