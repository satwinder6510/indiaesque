Mumbai's transport system carries over 8 million people daily across local trains, metros, buses, taxis, and auto-rickshaws. You'll navigate this massive network efficiently once you understand the basics, timing, and pricing. This guide covers every transport option with specific costs, safety tips, and insider knowledge to move around the city like a local.

## Local Trains — Mumbai's Lifeline

Mumbai's suburban railway network spans 465 kilometers with three main lines: Western, Central, and Harbour. These trains carry 75% of Mumbai's commuters and connect every major area of the city.

### Rush Hours to Absolutely Avoid

Never board local trains during peak hours: 8-10am and 5-8pm on weekdays. Trains pack beyond belief with people hanging out of doors. You'll see commuters crushed against each other, unable to move. Travel during off-peak hours (10am-5pm or after 9pm) for comfortable journeys with available seats.

### The Three Railway Lines

**Western Line** runs from Churchgate to Virar, covering South Mumbai, Bandra, Andheri, and Borivali. Take this line for Colaba, Marine Drive, Bandra-Kurla Complex, and the international airport.

**Central Line** connects Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) to Kasara/Khopoli via Dadar, Kurla, and Thane. Use this for reaching Dharavi, eastern suburbs, and Navi Mumbai connections.

**Harbour Line** branches from Central Line at Vadala Road, serving Vashi, Panvel, and Navi Mumbai areas.

### Ticketing and Pricing

Buy tickets at station counters or use the UTS app on your phone. A first-class ticket costs 10 times more than second class but guarantees a seat during off-peak hours.

Sample second-class fares:
- Churchgate to Andheri: ₹15 ($0.18)
- CST to Thane: ₹20 ($0.24)
- Dadar to Borivali: ₹25 ($0.30)

First-class fares:
- Churchgate to Andheri: ₹150 ($1.80)
- CST to Thane: ₹200 ($2.40)

### Safety on Local Trains

Board the second car from the engine — it's designated for senior citizens and has less crowding. Women travel in ladies' compartments (first four cars of each train). Keep bags in front of your body and hold onto railings firmly. Pickpocketing happens during boarding and alighting when crowds push.

## Mumbai Metro System

Mumbai Metro currently operates three lines with more under construction. The air-conditioned trains provide relief from the heat and connect key business districts.

### Metro Lines and Coverage

**Line 1 (Blue Line)** runs from Versova to Ghatkopar via Andheri, covering the western suburbs to eastern suburbs. Perfect for airport connections and reaching Bandra-Kurla Complex.

**Line 2A and 7 (Red and Yellow Lines)** connect Dahisar to Andheri East and Santa Cruz to Dhanukarwadi respectively.

### Metro Fares and Timing

Metro fares range from ₹10-60 ($0.12-0.72) depending on distance. Trains run every 3-4 minutes from 5:30am to 12:30am. Unlike local trains, metros maintain comfortable capacity even during peak hours.

Buy tokens at stations or use a metro card for faster entry. You can also use smartphone apps for digital tickets.

## Taxis and Ride-Hailing Apps

### Traditional Mumbai Taxis

Black-yellow Premier Padmini taxis operate throughout Mumbai with regulated meter rates. The base fare starts at ₹25 with ₹17.29 charged per kilometer. However, most taxi drivers refuse to use meters for tourists and quote inflated fixed rates.

Always insist on the meter. If the driver refuses, find another taxi or use ride-hailing apps. Legitimate meter rates for common routes:
- Colaba to Bandra: ₹180-220 ($2.15-2.65)
- Fort to Andheri: ₹280-320 ($3.35-3.85)
- Dadar to Airport: ₹200-250 ($2.40-3.00)

### Uber and Ola Services

Download both Uber and Ola apps before arriving. Both operate extensively across Mumbai with transparent pricing and GPS tracking. Ola often costs 10-15% less than Uber.

**Uber/Ola Categories:**
- **Mini/Micro:** ₹8-10 per km ($0.10-0.12)
- **Sedan/Prime:** ₹12-15 per km ($0.14-0.18)
- **SUV/XL:** ₹18-22 per km ($0.22-0.26)

Surge pricing applies during peak hours and bad weather, increasing costs by 1.5-3x normal rates.

### Auto-Rickshaws

Auto-rickshaws operate in suburbs but not in South Mumbai below Mahim. Meter rates start at ₹18 with ₹12.47 per kilometer. Like taxis, drivers often refuse meters and demand fixed rates from tourists.

## Airport Transfers and Connections

Getting between Mumbai's airports and the city center requires planning based on your destination and budget.

### From Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport

**Pre-paid Taxis** operate from designated counters outside arrivals. Rates to popular destinations:
- Colaba/Fort: ₹900-1,200 ($11-14)
- Bandra: ₹400-600 ($5-7)
- Powai: ₹300-450 ($4-5)

**Uber/Ola** costs slightly less but pickup locations vary by terminal. Expect ₹600-1,000 ($7-12) to South Mumbai depending on traffic and surge pricing.

**Airport Express Train** runs from Terminal 1 to Andheri station for ₹110 ($1.30). From Andheri, connect to Western Line local trains or metro. Total journey time to South Mumbai: 75-90 minutes including connections.

**BEST Buses** (Route AC-09) connect both terminals to various city points for ₹45-75 ($0.55-0.90). Journey time: 90-120 minutes depending on traffic.

### Traffic Timing Considerations

Airport transfers take 45-90 minutes depending on traffic. Avoid departing during rush hours when journey times double. Early morning (5-7am) and late night (10pm-6am) offer fastest travel times.

## Mumbai Metro and Monorail Integration

The Mumbai Monorail connects Chembur to Wadala via 11 stations. While limited in coverage, it provides good connectivity to eastern suburbs and Navi Mumbai.

Monorail fares: ₹5-15 ($0.06-0.18) per journey. Trains run every 5-7 minutes from 5:30am to 10:30pm.

## BEST Buses — The Budget Option

Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) operates over 3,000 buses across Mumbai. While crowded and slow during peak hours, buses reach every corner of the city.

### Bus Categories and Fares

**Regular Buses:** ₹8-25 ($0.10-0.30) for most journeys

## Ferry Services

Mumbai's ferry services connect South Mumbai to Navi Mumbai and various creek points. The most useful route for tourists runs from Gateway of India to Mandwa (for Alibaug) and Elephanta Caves.

**Gateway of India to Elephanta Caves:** ₹150 ($1.80) return ticket, 1-hour journey each way. Ferries run every 30 minutes from 9am-5pm.

**Ferry to Mandwa:** ₹185 ($2.20) one-way, connects to Alibaug buses. Journey time: 45 minutes.

## Transportation Safety Tips

### Personal Security

Keep phones and wallets in front pockets or bags worn in front of your body. Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics openly. [Mumbai's safety record for tourists](/mumbai/is-mumbai-safe-for-tourists/) remains good, but petty theft occurs in crowded transport.

### Women's Safety

Ladies' compartments in local trains provide safer travel for women. Female passengers can sit in the front section of BEST buses designated for women. Uber and Ola offer women driver options during certain hours.

### Emergency Numbers

Keep these numbers saved in your phone:
- Mumbai Police: 100
