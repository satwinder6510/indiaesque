**Getting from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport to Mumbai's city center takes 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on your transport choice and traffic. Uber costs ₹800-1,500 ($10-18), while the metro connection costs ₹60-80 ($0.70-1) but requires transfers.**

Mumbai Airport sits 30 kilometers north of the main tourist areas in South Mumbai. Your transport choice dramatically affects both cost and travel time, especially during peak hours (8-11 AM and 6-9 PM) when traffic crawls.

## Uber and Ola Rides

Book Uber or Ola directly from the arrivals area - both terminals have designated pickup zones. To reach Colaba or Gateway of India, expect to pay ₹800-1,200 ($10-14) during normal hours. Bandra and Juhu cost ₹400-600 ($5-7), while Andheri runs ₹300-450 ($4-5).

Surge pricing hits hard during monsoons, late nights, and rush hours - rates can double to ₹1,500-2,000 ($18-24) for South Mumbai destinations. The airport to Colaba takes 1-2 hours depending on traffic, with the worst delays between Mahim and Worli.

Terminal 2 (international) has Uber pickup on Level 2, Gate 2A. Terminal 1 (domestic) uses the ground floor pickup area near Gate 1. Both terminals charge ₹40-60 parking fees that drivers often add to your fare.

## Pre-Paid Taxis

Pre-paid taxi counters at both terminals offer fixed rates and avoid haggling. The system works reliably - pay at the counter, get a receipt, and hand it to your assigned driver.

**Terminal 1 rates:**
- South Mumbai (Colaba, Fort): ₹850 ($10)
- Bandra: ₹450 ($5)
- Andheri: ₹350 ($4)

**Terminal 2 rates:**
- South Mumbai: ₹900 ($11)
- Bandra: ₹500 ($6)
- Andheri: ₹400 ($5)

Add ₹15 per large bag and 25% surcharge between 11 PM and 5 AM. The counters operate 24/7, but queues get long during peak arrival times (early morning and late evening international flights).

## Airport Metro Connection

The Airport Line connects Terminal 1 to Andheri metro station in 7 minutes for ₹20 ($0.25). From Andheri, take the Western Line to reach different parts of Mumbai - Bandra costs another ₹15, while Churchgate (near Colaba) adds ₹25 more.

Total journey time to South Mumbai: 90-120 minutes including transfers and waiting. The metro runs 5 AM to midnight, with trains every 3-4 minutes during peak hours.

**Key transfer stations:**
- Andheri: Airport Line to Western Line
- Dadar: Western to Central Line
- Wadala Road: Central Line to Harbor Line

This route works best if you're staying near major stations and traveling with minimal luggage. For comprehensive metro information, check our [Mumbai Transport Guide](/mumbai/transport/).

## Airport Shuttle Services

Several hotels run shuttle services, particularly in Andheri and Bandra. Ask when booking - rates typically range ₹200-500 ($2-6) per person. Mumbai Airport also operates paid shuttle buses to major hotels for ₹150-250 ($2-3).

Private shuttle companies like Airport Shuttle Mumbai charge ₹400-600 ($5-7) for shared rides to South Mumbai. Book online or at arrival counters in both terminals.

## Terminal-Specific Details

**Terminal 1 (Domestic):** Smaller and more crowded. Pre-paid taxi counter is immediately outside the arrivals gate. Uber pickup requires a 2-minute walk to the designated area. The Airport Metro station sits right outside.

**Terminal 2 (International):** Much larger with more transport options. Multiple pre-paid taxi counters reduce waiting times. Uber pickup is clearly marked on Level 2. Free shuttle connects to Terminal 1 and the metro station every 15 minutes.

If connecting between terminals, use the free shuttle bus - it takes 10-15 minutes and runs 24/7.

## Timing Your Journey

**Best travel times:** 11 PM - 6 AM (minimal traffic, 45-60 minutes to South Mumbai)
**Worst travel times:** 8-11 AM and 6-9 PM (can take 2+ hours)
**Monsoon delays:** Add 30-45 minutes extra during heavy rains (June-September)

Morning international flights from Europe and the US arrive between 2-8 AM, creating the smoothest airport exit experience. Evening arrivals face the worst traffic when heading to popular areas covered in our guide on [where to stay in Mumbai](/mumbai/where-to-stay-mumbai/).

Budget at least 90 minutes for airport to South Mumbai during busy periods. If you're planning to explore immediately, consider our recommendations for [things to do in Mumbai](/mumbai/) that account for your arrival timing.
