## Combining Food Tours with Other Activities

Food tours pair well with other Mumbai experiences. Consider combining your tour with [heritage walks](/mumbai/heritage-walks/) through the same neighborhoods, or visit [Mumbai's markets](/mumbai/markets/) to buy spices and ingredients you've tasted.

Many visitors schedule food tours on their first day to get oriented with [Mumbai's transport system](/mumbai/getting-around-mumbai/) and neighborhood layout. This helps you return independently to favorite vendors discovered during guided tours.

- Gujarati thalis in Zaveri Bazaar
- South Indian breakfast items
- Jain food options (no onion, garlic, or root vegetables)
