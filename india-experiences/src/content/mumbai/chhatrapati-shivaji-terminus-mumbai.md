**Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) is a UNESCO World Heritage railway station in Mumbai, built in 1887 in Victorian Gothic Revival style with Indian architectural elements. This architectural marvel serves 3 million daily passengers and stands as one of Mumbai's most iconic landmarks.**

## Architecture and Design

CST represents the finest example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India. British architect Frederick William Stevens designed this magnificent structure, combining European Gothic elements with traditional Indian craftsmanship. The building features pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses typical of Gothic architecture, while Indian artisans added intricate stone carvings, decorative motifs, and colorful stained glass windows.

The central dome rises 300 feet above ground level, crowned by a 14-foot statue of Progress holding a flaming torch. Eight-pointed stars and intricate floral patterns carved from local Kurla stone decorate the facade. The main entrance hall showcases beautiful tile work and ornate ironwork that reflects the craftsmanship of the late 19th century.

## Historical Significance

Originally named Victoria Terminus after Queen Victoria, the station took 10 years to complete at a cost of ₹1.6 million (equivalent to ₹260 crores today). The government renamed it Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in 1996 to honor the Maratha warrior king Shivaji Maharaj.

UNESCO designated CST as a World Heritage Site in 2004, recognizing its outstanding universal value as an exceptional example of late 19th-century railway architecture. The station represents the meeting point of two architectural traditions - Victorian Gothic and traditional Indian styles.

## Visiting CST Today

CST operates as the headquarters of Central Railway and connects Mumbai to major Indian cities including Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad. The station handles both long-distance trains and suburban services, processing over 3 million passengers daily.

You can explore the main entrance hall and admire the exterior architecture freely. The booking halls feature original Victorian-era fixtures, including ornate ticket counters and vintage clocks. The stained glass windows create beautiful light patterns throughout the day, particularly stunning during late afternoon hours.

## Photography Guidelines

Photography restrictions apply strictly inside CST station. You can photograph the exterior facade and main entrance hall without issues, but security personnel prohibit cameras on platforms and railway areas. The restrictions exist for security reasons following the 2008 terrorist attacks.

For the best exterior shots, position yourself at the D.N. Road entrance or from the nearby BMC building area. Early morning (7-9 AM) and late afternoon (4-6 PM) provide optimal lighting conditions for photography.
