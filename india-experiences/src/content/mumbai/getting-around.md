faq:
  - question: "How do I get from Mumbai airport to the city?"
    answer: "From Terminal 2 (international): Uber/Ola to South Mumbai costs ₹600-1,000 (1-2 hours depending on traffic). Prepaid taxi ₹700-900. From Andheri: metro coming soon. The airport is far from tourist areas — allow time."
  - question: "Should I use Mumbai local trains?"
    answer: "Yes, for longer distances. They're the fastest way to move through the city — Churchgate to Bandra in 30 minutes vs. 90+ by road. Avoid rush hours (8-11 AM, 5-9 PM) when they're extremely crowded. Use first class for comfort (₹65-150 vs. ₹5-20)."
  - question: "Is Uber available in Mumbai?"
    answer: "Yes. Uber and Ola work throughout Mumbai. Essential for door-to-door travel, especially in South Mumbai and to/from airports. Fares: ₹150-500 within zones, ₹600-1,000+ for long distances. Traffic makes timing unpredictable."

Mumbai is spread out and traffic-choked. Local trains are the backbone — learn to use them and the city opens up.

## Mumbai Local Trains

### The Lifeline

12 million daily riders. Fastest way to cover distances. Terrifying during rush hour. Essential knowledge for any Mumbai visit.

### Lines

**Western Line:** Churchgate → Virar (runs through Bandra, Andheri)
**Central Line:** CSMT → Kalyan (runs through Dadar)
**Harbour Line:** CSMT → Panvel

**For tourists:** Western Line most useful (Churchgate, Mumbai Central, Bandra, Andheri).

### Key Stations

| Station | Near |
|---------|------|
| Churchgate | Gateway, Colaba (taxi needed) |
| Mumbai Central | Central tourist area |
| Bandra | Bandra neighbourhood, links |
| Andheri | Airport area, suburbs |
| CSMT | Victoria Terminus, Crawford Market |

### Classes

**Second class:** ₹5-20. Extremely crowded in rush hour.
**First class:** ₹65-150. Still crowded but manageable. Worth it for tourists.

### Timing

**Rush hours:** 8-11 AM and 5-9 PM. Avoid as a tourist. Dangerously crowded.
**Off-peak:** 11 AM - 4 PM is comfortable. Late evening also fine.

### Women's Compartment

Marked clearly. Safer and less crowded for female travellers. Men face fines for entering.

### How to Use

1. Buy ticket at counter (cash) or use UTS app (requires Indian number)
2. Check platform for your direction
3. Board quickly — doors don't close
4. Hold on — trains move while people board
5. Start moving to door before your station

### Tips

- Carry small change for tickets
- Keep bags close
- Phones get stolen — keep in inside pocket
- Don't stand near doors (people push)
- Ask locals — Mumbaikars are helpful

## Taxis and Autos

### Black and Yellow Taxis

Mumbai's iconic black cabs. Metered, relatively honest.

**How it works:**
1. Flag down taxi
2. Confirm driver will go to your destination
3. Meter starts automatically
4. Pay meter amount (or check fare card for conversion)

**Approximate fares:**
- Minimum: ₹25
- Per km: ₹15-20
- Colaba to Bandra: ₹300-400

### Auto Rickshaws

Only operate in suburbs (north of Bandra). Not allowed in South Mumbai.

**Fares:** Similar to taxis. Negotiate or insist on meter.

---

## Uber and Ola

Essential for door-to-door convenience.

### When to Use

- Airport transfers
- Within South Mumbai (train-free zone)
- Night travel
- Heavy luggage
- Avoiding train rush hour

### Typical Fares

| Route | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Colaba to Bandra | ₹350-500 |
| Bandra to Juhu | ₹150-250 |
| Airport to Colaba | ₹600-1,000 |
| Within South Mumbai | ₹100-200 |

### Tips

- Traffic makes timing unpredictable
- Rush hour can triple journey times
- Surge pricing hits during rain and peak times
- Ola often slightly cheaper than Uber

## Rush Hour Reality

Mumbai traffic and trains during rush hour are legendary:

**8-11 AM and 5-9 PM:**
- Trains at 200% capacity
- Roads gridlocked
- What takes 30 minutes can take 2 hours

**Tourist strategy:**
- Start sightseeing after 10 AM
- Return before 5 PM or after 9 PM
- Use trains off-peak, Uber for rush hour if necessary
- Stay near your activities
