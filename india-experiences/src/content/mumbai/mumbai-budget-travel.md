## Smart Money-Saving Strategies

**Shopping Smart**
Visit [local markets](/mumbai/markets/) like Crawford Market or Linking Road for bargains. Avoid hotel gift shops and airport stores. Bargain aggressively at street markets but pay asking prices for food.

**Communication**
Local SIM cards cost ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80) with data plans. Free Wi-Fi works at malls, cafes, and some railway stations. WhatsApp calling saves international charges.

**Timing Visits**
Monsoon season (June-September) offers lower hotel rates but restricts outdoor activities. Post-monsoon (October-February) brings peak prices but perfect weather. Plan around festivals for cultural experiences.

**Banking**
ATM withdrawal fees run ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) for international cards. State Bank of India ATMs often have lower fees. Carry cash for street food and local transport as card acceptance varies.

Mumbai rewards budget travelers who embrace local experiences over luxury amenities. Street food tastes better than hotel restaurants, local trains move faster than taxis during rush hour, and free attractions often provide the most memorable moments.
