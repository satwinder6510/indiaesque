**Colaba Causeway is Mumbai's most famous shopping street, stretching from Regal Cinema to the Gateway of India. You'll find jewelry, handicrafts, clothes, antiques, and street food here, with shops open 10am-9pm daily.**

This pedestrian-friendly street attracts both tourists and locals hunting for everything from silver jewelry to vintage Bollywood posters. The key to shopping here is aggressive bargaining and knowing exactly what you want.

## What to Buy at Colaba Causeway

- Oxidized silver jewelry: ₹200-800 ($2.50-10)
- Semi-precious stone accessories: ₹500-2,000 ($6-24)
- Traditional Indian bangles: ₹100-500 ($1.25-6)
- Leather bags and wallets: ₹800-2,500 ($10-30)

- Wooden elephants and figurines: ₹150-800 ($2-10)

- Printed t-shirts: ₹300-800 ($3.50-10)
- Scarves and shawls: ₹200-1,000 ($2.50-12)
- Bohemian dresses: ₹600-1,800 ($7-22)

## Bargaining Strategies That Work

Start at 30% of the quoted price and negotiate up slowly. Shopkeepers expect this - their initial prices are inflated 3-4 times the actual value.

Effective bargaining tactics:
- Walk away if they won't budge - they'll often call you back with a better price
- Buy multiple items from the same vendor for bulk discounts
- Pay cash - many shops offer 5-10% discounts for cash payments
- Shop in the evening when vendors want to clear inventory

Never accept the first three price quotes. The real negotiation starts around the fourth counter-offer.

## Best Shops and Stalls

**Phillips Antiques** (near Regal Cinema): Genuine antiques and collectibles, though prices are higher and less negotiable.

**Contemporary Arts & Crafts**: Quality silver jewelry with better craftsmanship than street vendors.

**Fabindia** (Jeroo Building): Fixed prices but reliable quality for Indian textiles and clothing.

**Street stalls between Afghan Church and Cafe Mondegar**: Best prices for accessories, bags, and casual clothing.

## Where to Eat While Shopping

Take breaks at these nearby spots without losing your shopping momentum:

**Leopold Cafe** (Colaba Causeway): Mumbai's most famous restaurant, serving continental and Indian food. Main dishes ₹400-800 ($5-10).

**Cafe Mondegar** (Metro House): German-style cafe with Bollywood memorabilia and cold beer. Meals ₹350-700 ($4-8).

**Street food stalls**: Try bhel puri (₹40-60), pav bhaji (₹80-120), or fresh fruit juice (₹50-100) from vendors along the street.

## Getting There and Around

**By train**: Take the local train to Churchgate Station (Western Line), then taxi or bus (₹150-200) to Colaba.

**By taxi/Uber**: From Mumbai Airport expect ₹600-1,200 ($7-14) depending on traffic.

## Best Time to Shop

Visit between 11am-1pm or after 6pm to avoid peak crowds. Tuesday through Thursday see fewer tourists, giving you better bargaining power.

Monsoon season (June-September) means fewer crowds but also wet conditions that make walking difficult.
