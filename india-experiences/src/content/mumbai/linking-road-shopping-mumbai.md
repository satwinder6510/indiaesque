**Linking Road in Bandra is Mumbai's most famous street shopping destination, offering trendy fashion items at bargain prices, excellent street food, and the city's best haggling experience. The 1-kilometer stretch runs parallel to Hill Road and is busiest between 6-9 PM when bargaining works best.**

## Getting to Linking Road

Take the Western line to Bandra station and exit west. The main shopping stretch starts near the McDonald's junction and runs south toward Turner Road. If you're coming from South Mumbai, the journey takes 30-45 minutes by train. Auto-rickshaws from Bandra station cost ₹30-50 ($0.35-0.60) to reach the heart of Linking Road.

## What to Shop For

Linking Road specializes in trendy fashion at fraction of mall prices. You'll find:

**Women's Fashion**: Crop tops (₹200-400/$2.50-5), palazzo pants (₹300-600/$3.50-7), ethnic wear kurtas (₹400-800/$5-10), and western dresses (₹500-1,200/$6-15).

**Men's Clothing**: Printed t-shirts (₹250-500/$3-6), jeans (₹600-1,200/$7-15), shirts (₹400-800/$5-10), and shorts (₹300-600/$3.50-7).

**Accessories**: Sunglasses (₹150-400/$2-5), bags (₹300-800/$3.50-10), jewelry (₹100-500/$1-6), and phone cases (₹100-300/$1-3.50).

The quality ranges from decent copies to original export surplus items. Check stitching, fabric quality, and zippers before buying.

## Bargaining Like a Local

Start your negotiation at 30-40% of the asking price. Vendors initially quote 2-3 times their selling price, especially for tourists. Walk away if they don't budge - they'll usually call you back with a better offer.

Buy multiple items from the same vendor for better deals. If something costs ₹800, offer ₹300 and settle around ₹450-500. Evening crowds work in your favor as vendors want to clear stock.

Learn basic Hindi phrases: "Kam karo" (reduce the price), "Last price?" and "Bohot zyada hai" (too expensive) help in negotiations.

## Best Street Food Stops

Linking Road offers excellent street food between shopping rounds:

**Elco Market**: Just off Linking Road, famous for pani puri (₹60-80/$0.75-1), bhel puri (₹80-100/$1-1.25), and Chinese food from multiple stalls.

**Bandra Bandstand Food Trucks**: 10-minute walk from Linking Road's southern end. Try vada pav (₹30-50/$0.35-0.60) and fresh coconut water (₹40-60/$0.50-0.75).

**Roadside Chaat**: Scattered along the street, offering Mumbai's famous street snacks. Stick to busy stalls with high turnover for fresher food.

Consider joining organized [food tours in Mumbai](/mumbai/food-tours/) to explore more street food safely with local guides.

## Hill Road Connection

Hill Road runs parallel to Linking Road and offers a different shopping experience. Hill Road has more established shops, fixed prices, and branded items. Walk between both streets - Hill Road for quality branded goods and Linking Road for bargain hunting.

The connecting lanes between Hill Road and Linking Road house small designer boutiques and cafes. These side streets are less crowded and offer unique finds.

## Nearby Mall Shopping

After street shopping, visit nearby malls for international brands:

**Palladium Mall** (5-minute auto ride): Zara, H&M, Forever 21, and other international brands. Prices are standard retail but quality is guaranteed.

**Phoenix Marketcity** (15 minutes by auto): Larger mall with more brands and a food court. Take a break here if street shopping gets overwhelming.

Compare prices between Linking Road and these malls - sometimes the difference is smaller than expected, especially during mall sales.

## Local Designer Stores

Bandra hosts several local designers with stores near Linking Road:

**Pali Hill Area**: 10-minute walk uphill from Linking Road's northern end. Small boutiques selling original designs at mid-range prices (₹1,500-5,000/$18-60).

**Bandra West Side Streets**: Explore Pali Naka and surrounding areas for independent designers and concept stores.

These stores offer unique pieces you won't find elsewhere, though prices are higher than street shopping.

## Timing Your Visit

**Best Time**: 6-9 PM when crowds peak and bargaining is most effective. Vendors are eager to sell during busy hours.

**Avoid**: Weekday afternoons (2-5 PM) when foot traffic is low and vendors are less flexible on prices.

**Weekends**: More crowded but better variety as vendors stock up. Go early (11 AM-1 PM) or late (7-9 PM) to avoid peak crowds.

Monsoon months (June-September) can be challenging with waterlogged streets, but vendors offer better deals to attract fewer customers.

## Navigation Tips

Linking Road is roughly 1 kilometer long. Start from the McDonald's end (near Bandra station) and work your way south. The northern section has more trendy items, while the southern end offers traditional wear and accessories.

Use Google Maps to navigate the side lanes - some of the best deals are found in the smaller connecting streets. The area is well-lit and safe for evening shopping.

## Shopping Strategy

Carry cash - most vendors don't accept cards. ATMs are available near McDonald's and Hill Road junction.

Bring a large bag or backpack for your purchases. Plastic bags from vendors often tear with heavy items.

Try items before buying when possible. Sizes can be inconsistent, especially for local brands.

Take photos of items you like but want to compare prices for - vendors at the other end might have similar items cheaper.
