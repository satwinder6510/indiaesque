## Money-Saving Tips

Buy SIM cards from official stores rather than street vendors to avoid activation issues. If you're planning to [explore Mumbai's markets](/mumbai/markets/) or take [heritage walks](/mumbai/heritage-walks/), having reliable data helps with navigation and booking transport through apps like Uber or Ola.

Consider sharing data with travel companions - most plans allow hotspot usage without additional charges.

## Recharge and Top-ups

Recharge your plan through:
- MyJio/MyAirtel apps
- Paytm or PhonePe apps
- Physical recharge shops (available every few blocks)
- Online through operator websites

Keep some cash handy as smaller recharge shops don't always accept cards.

## Data Usage Tips

Mumbai's [extensive transport network](/mumbai/transport/) relies heavily on apps for bookings and real-time updates. Budget around 500MB-1GB daily for navigation, transport apps, and staying connected while exploring the city.

Video calls and streaming consume data quickly - use hotel WiFi for heavy usage and save mobile data for essential connectivity while out exploring.
