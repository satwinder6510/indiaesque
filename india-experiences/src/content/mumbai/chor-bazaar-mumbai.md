**Chor Bazaar, Mumbai's famous "Thieves Market," is a sprawling antique market near Mohammed Ali Road where you can find vintage furniture, Bollywood memorabilia, and colonial artifacts. Visit between 9am-12pm (closed Fridays) and bargain hard - expect to pay 30-50% of the initial quoted price.**

Located in Mumbai's Muslim quarter, Chor Bazaar has been operating since the British era when it was known as "Shor Bazaar" (noisy market). The British mispronounced it as "Chor" (thief), and the name stuck. Today, this maze of narrow lanes houses one of India's largest markets for antiques, vintage items, and curiosities.

## Getting to Chor Bazaar

Take the Western Railway to Mumbai Central station, then catch an auto-rickshaw for ₹40-60 ($0.50-0.75) to reach Mutton Street, the main thoroughfare of Chor Bazaar. You can also take a taxi from South Mumbai for ₹150-200 ($1.80-2.40). The nearest landmark is Minara Masjid on Mohammed Ali Road.

## What to Buy at Chor Bazaar

### Antique Furniture
Victorian chairs, colonial-era wardrobes, carved wooden tables, and ornate mirrors fill the shops along Mutton Street. Prices range from ₹5,000-50,000 ($60-600) depending on age and condition. Shop owners provide certificates of authenticity for genuine antiques.

### Bollywood Memorabilia
Original movie posters from the 1950s-80s cost ₹2,000-15,000 ($24-180). You'll find lobby cards, publicity stills, and even film equipment. The posters from classics like "Mughal-e-Azam" and "Sholay" command premium prices.

### Vintage Electronics
Working gramophones start at ₹8,000 ($95), while vintage radios cost ₹3,000-12,000 ($35-145). Old cameras, including Leicas and Rolleiflex models, range from ₹5,000-25,000 ($60-300). Test everything before buying as return policies don't exist.

### Brassware and Artifacts
British-era brass items, old coins, stamps, and decorative pieces are abundant. Brass figurines start at ₹500 ($6), while larger pieces like vintage scales or nautical instruments cost ₹2,000-8,000 ($24-95).

## How to Haggle

Start by offering 30% of the quoted price. Sellers typically inflate prices by 200-300%, so aggressive bargaining is expected. Walk away if they don't budge - this often brings better offers. For items above ₹10,000 ($120), negotiate for 10-15 minutes and expect to settle at 40-50% of the initial price.

Don't show excessive interest in expensive items initially. Browse casually, ask about multiple pieces, then circle back to your target item. Speaking basic Hindi phrases like "kam karo" (reduce the price) helps establish rapport.

## Best Shopping Strategy

Visit multiple shops before making decisions. Similar items appear across different stalls with varying price points. The shops on Mutton Street are more organized but pricier than the narrow side lanes where you'll find better deals.

Carry cash - card payments aren't accepted. Bring small denominations for easier negotiations. Large notes make it harder to bargain effectively as sellers assume you have more money to spend.

## Timing Your Visit

Arrive between 9am-11am when shops are setting up and you get first pick of newly arrived items. The market gets chaotic after noon with crowds making navigation difficult. Most shops close by 7pm.

Friday is a complete holiday as this is a Muslim-dominated area. Saturday mornings are ideal for serious antique hunting when fresh stock arrives from estates and collectors.

## What to Avoid

Don't buy items claiming to be ancient artifacts - most are reproductions. Avoid electronics without testing them first. Skip items that seem too good to be true; if a "Rolex" costs ₹2,000 ($24), it's definitely fake.

Be wary of sellers pushing urgent sales with stories about leaving town tomorrow. This pressure tactic aims to prevent price comparison and proper inspection.

## Practical Tips

Wear comfortable shoes as you'll walk on uneven surfaces and narrow lanes. Keep valuables secure - while generally safe, crowded areas attract pickpockets. Carry a measuring tape for furniture purchases and arrange transport for large items beforehand.

Many shop owners speak English, but basic Hindi helps with better prices. Ask about the history of items - dealers often share fascinating stories about their pieces' origins.

Take photos of items you're considering but visit other shops first. Return to make final decisions after seeing all options available in your budget range.
