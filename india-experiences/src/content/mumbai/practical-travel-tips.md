faq:
  - question: "How much does a trip to Mumbai cost?"
    answer: "Budget: ₹2,500-4,000/day ($30-48) for hostels, street food, and local trains. Mid-range: ₹6,000-10,000/day ($72-120) for 3-star hotels and restaurants. Luxury: ₹20,000+/day ($240+) for 5-star stays and fine dining. Mumbai is India's most expensive city."
  - question: "Is Mumbai expensive for tourists?"
    answer: "Yes, relatively. It's India's priciest city — hotels cost 30-50% more than Delhi or Jaipur. But street food is cheap, local trains cost ₹5-20, and many attractions are free or low-cost. Smart budget travellers can manage."
  - question: "Should I visit Mumbai during monsoon?"
    answer: "It's a unique experience if you're prepared. June-September brings heavy rain, flooding in some areas, but also a magical atmosphere. Marine Drive in the rain, chai weather, fewer crowds. Avoid if you hate wet clothes. Peak monsoon is July-August."
  - question: "What visa do I need for Mumbai?"
    answer: "Most tourists need an e-Visa. Apply online at indianvisaonline.gov.in at least 4 days before travel. 30-day tourist e-Visa costs $25. Same visa requirements as rest of India — Mumbai is just the entry point."

## Budget Planning

### Daily Costs

| Style | Accommodation | Food | Transport | Total/Day |
|-------|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Budget | ₹1,000-2,000 | ₹500-800 | ₹200-400 | ₹2,500-4,000 |
| Mid-range | ₹4,000-7,000 | ₹1,500-2,500 | ₹500-1,000 | ₹6,000-10,000 |
| Luxury | ₹15,000+ | ₹5,000+ | ₹2,000+ | ₹20,000+ |

### Why Mumbai Is Expensive

- Hotel rates 30-50% higher than other cities
- South Mumbai (tourist area) is particularly pricey
- Restaurants in tourist areas charge premium
- Uber/taxi costs add up in this spread-out city

### Money-Saving Tips

1. **Stay in Bandra or Andheri** — cheaper than Colaba
2. **Use local trains** — ₹5-20 vs. ₹300+ Uber
3. **Eat street food** — vada pav for ₹20, meal for ₹100
4. **Free attractions** — Marine Drive, Juhu Beach, Bandra Worli Sea Link views
5. **Avoid Colaba Causeway tourist prices** — bargain hard

## Money and Currency

### Cash

- **Currency:** Indian Rupee (INR/₹)
- **ATMs:** Everywhere — HDFC, ICICI, AXIS best
- **Withdrawal limits:** ₹10,000-20,000 per transaction
- **Small notes:** Keep ₹10-100 for street food, autos

### Cards

- Widely accepted in South Mumbai, restaurants, shops
- Less common at street stalls
- Visa/Mastercard work best
- Inform bank of travel dates

### UPI Payments

Google Pay and PhonePe are everywhere — but require Indian bank account. Tourists use cash or cards.

## SIM Cards and Internet

### Getting a SIM

**At airport:**
- Jio and Airtel counters in arrivals
- Tourist SIM: ₹500-700 for 28 days, 1.5-2GB daily data
- Bring passport and photo
- Activation: 1-4 hours

**In city:**
- Any Airtel/Jio store
- Same documents required

### Which Provider

**Jio:** Cheapest, best coverage in Mumbai
**Airtel:** Reliable, slightly pricier

## Monsoon Travel (June-September)

### What to Expect

Mumbai's monsoon is intense. Heavy rain, especially July-August. Streets flood. Trains sometimes halt. But it's also atmospheric and fewer tourists.

**Pros:**
- Dramatic skies, photography opportunities
- Marine Drive in the rain is magical
- Chai weather
- Hotel prices drop
- Fewer tourists

**Cons:**
- Flooding in low-lying areas
- Transport disruptions
- Some attractions less enjoyable wet
- Mosquitoes increase

### Monsoon Survival Tips

1. **Waterproof everything** — bag, phone, documents
2. **Pack quick-dry clothes** — you will get wet
3. **Umbrella is essential** — buy a sturdy one
4. **Avoid rush hour on rain days** — trains overcrowded
5. **Check weather before going out** — heavy rain days are stay-in days
6. **Stay in South Mumbai** — better drainage, less flooding

### Best Monsoon Experiences

- Marine Drive during rain (pakoras and chai)
- Watching storms from Sea Link viewpoint
- Colaba cafes waiting out showers
- Fresh seafood at Leopold or Trishna

## First-Time Visitor Guide

### What to Expect

Mumbai is intense. India's biggest city, fastest pace, most cosmopolitan. You'll experience crushing crowds, colonial architecture, Bollywood glamour, and some of India's best food.

**Key differences from other Indian cities:**
- More fast-paced and less patience for tourists
- More expensive
- More Western in many ways
- Better infrastructure
- Women generally feel safer

### Essential Knowledge

**Timing:**
- Local trains run 4 AM to 1 AM
- Shops: 10 AM to 9 PM

**Dress:**
- Mumbai is more liberal than other cities
- Western clothes fine everywhere
- Still cover up at temples
- Beach wear only at beaches (obviously)

### Common Mistakes

1. **Underestimating distances** — the city is huge
2. **Not using local trains** — they're the only way to move fast
3. **Spending all time in South Mumbai** — miss Bandra, Juhu
4. **Eating only at tourist restaurants** — street food is the point
5. **Avoiding monsoon entirely** — it's a valid experience
