**Mumbai's Bollywood tours range from ₹1,200-2,500 ($14-30) for Film City experiences to celebrity home tours in Juhu and Bandra, plus visits to iconic theaters and museums showcasing India's film capital.**

Mumbai produces over 1,000 films annually, making it the heart of Indian cinema. You can explore this world through organized tours that take you behind the scenes, past star homes, and into the venues that shaped Bollywood history.

## Film City Tours

Ramoji Film City and Goregaon Film City offer the most comprehensive Bollywood experiences. Tours cost ₹1,200-2,500 ($14-30) per person and last 4-6 hours. You'll see active film sets, meet junior artists, and watch live shooting when productions are running.

The tours include visits to permanent sets like palace replicas, village scenes, and urban backdrops used in countless films. You can also explore the costume and makeup departments where film magic happens daily.

Book through authorized operators like Bollywood Tourism or Mumbai Darshan. They provide air-conditioned transport from South Mumbai, Bandra, and Andheri. Tours run Tuesday to Sunday, 9 AM to 4 PM.

## Celebrity Home Tours

Juhu and Bandra house most Bollywood stars, and specialized tours take you past their residences. Popular stops include Shah Rukh Khan's Mannat, Amitabh Bachchan's Jalsa, and Salman Khan's Galaxy Apartments.

These 3-hour tours cost ₹800-1,500 ($10-18) per person. You'll drive along Carter Road, Bandstand Promenade, and JVPD Scheme where paparazzi often camp outside celebrity homes.

Combine celebrity tours with visits to Juhu Beach, where stars often shoot outdoor sequences. The tour guides share insider stories about film shoots, celebrity sightings, and Bollywood gossip.

## Studio Visits and Sets

Several Mumbai studios welcome visitors during non-shooting hours. Mehboob Studios in Bandra, Filmistan Studios in Goregaon, and Kamalistan Studios offer guided tours for ₹500-800 ($6-10) per person.

You'll see sound stages, editing rooms, and props warehouses. Some studios display costumes and set pieces from famous films. The 2-hour tours explain how films are made, from script to screen.

Call studios directly to check availability, as shooting schedules change frequently. Weekend visits work best as weekday bookings depend on production requirements.

## Iconic Cinema Experiences

Watch a film at Regal Cinema in Colaba, Mumbai's oldest theater operating since 1933. The Art Deco building has hosted countless Bollywood premieres and charges ₹150-300 ($2-4) for tickets.

Maratha Mandir near Marine Drive has screened "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" for over 25 years. Liberty Cinema and Metro Cinema also offer classic Bollywood viewing experiences in historic settings.

Book evening shows to experience the audience energy that makes Mumbai cinemas special. The cheering, clapping, and singing along create an atmosphere you won't find elsewhere.

## Bollywood Museums and Exhibitions

The Bollywood Museum at Bandra-Kurla Complex displays costumes, photographs, and memorabilia from six decades of Hindi cinema. Entry costs ₹200 ($2.50) for adults and ₹100 ($1.20) for children.

Exhibits include Madhubala's costumes, vintage film posters, and cameras used by legendary directors. Interactive displays let you experience dubbing and dance choreography.

The museum opens Tuesday to Sunday, 10 AM to 6 PM. Allow 2-3 hours for a complete visit. Photography is allowed in most sections, but video recording requires additional permits.

## Booking Requirements and Tips

Most Bollywood tours require advance booking, especially Film City visits which need 48-hour notice. Provide passport copies for foreign tourists and Aadhaar cards for Indian citizens.

Peak season (October to March) sees higher demand, so book a week ahead. Monsoon season (June to September) can disrupt outdoor shoots, affecting tour quality.

Wear comfortable shoes and carry water bottles, as tours involve significant walking. Respect photography restrictions at studios and maintain distance from celebrities during shoots.
