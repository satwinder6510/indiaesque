## Dining Etiquette and Tips

Eat with your right hand and don't hesitate to ask for refills - that's the point of unlimited service. However, take only what you can finish as wasting food is frowned upon. Most restaurants serve on steel plates or banana leaves, adding to the authentic experience.

Start with small portions of everything to taste, then request more of your favorites. Mix rice with dal and vegetables, use bread to scoop curries, and save sweets for the end. Servers continuously refill items, so pace yourself accordingly.

The best time to visit is lunch (12 PM to 3 PM) when preparations are freshest and variety is maximum. Many places offer lighter dinner thalis with fewer items.
