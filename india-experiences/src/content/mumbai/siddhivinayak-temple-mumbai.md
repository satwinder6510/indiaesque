**Siddhivinayak Temple in Prabhadevi is Mumbai's most revered Ganesh temple, open daily from 5:30 AM to 10:00 PM. Avoid Tuesday crowds, follow the dress code, and budget ₹51-501 for prasad offerings at this 200-year-old shrine.**

Mumbai's Siddhivinayak Temple draws millions of devotees annually to its location on SK Bole Road in Prabhadevi. Built in 1801, this temple houses a self-manifested (swayambhu) idol of Lord Ganesha that faces east, making it unique among Mumbai's spiritual sites.

## Getting to Siddhivinayak Temple

The temple sits in Prabhadevi, easily accessible by multiple transport options. Prabhadevi Railway Station on the Western Line is the closest, just a 5-minute walk away. If you're using the [Mumbai transport system](/mumbai/transport/), take trains to Prabhadevi and follow the crowd - everyone knows the temple route.

Auto-rickshaws and taxis cost ₹150-300 ($1.80-3.60) from South Mumbai areas like Colaba or Gateway of India. The BEST bus routes 37, 80, 81, and 476 stop near the temple. Parking is limited, so public transport works best for your visit.

## Darshan Timings and Crowd Management

Siddhivinayak Temple opens at 5:30 AM and closes at 10:00 PM daily. The temple follows a structured darshan system with different timing slots:

**Early Morning (5:30-8:00 AM)**: Lightest crowds, best for peaceful prayers
**Mid-Morning (8:00 AM-12:00 PM)**: Moderate crowds, good for families
**Afternoon (12:00-4:00 PM)**: Relatively quiet period
**Evening (4:00-7:00 PM)**: Heavy crowds begin
**Night (7:00-10:00 PM)**: Peak crowding, longest wait times

Tuesdays see extreme crowding as devotees believe Lord Ganesha grants wishes more readily on this day. Queue times stretch 3-6 hours on Tuesdays, compared to 30-90 minutes on other days.

## Dress Code and Entry Rules

Siddhivinayak Temple enforces strict dress codes for all visitors. Men must wear full shirts and pants - no shorts, sleeveless shirts, or casual wear. Women need covered shoulders and full-length clothing, avoiding short dresses, tank tops, or revealing outfits.

Remove footwear before entering the main temple area. The temple provides free shoe storage, but bring socks as floors get hot during daytime. Leather items including belts and purses are prohibited inside the sanctum.

Mobile phones are allowed, but photography inside the main shrine is restricted. Security checks happen at the entrance, similar to airport screenings.

## Prasad Options and Prices

The temple offers standardized prasad packages at fixed counters:

**₹51 Package ($0.60)**: Includes 2 modaks, 1 coconut, kumkum, and sacred thread
**₹101 Package ($1.20)**: Adds laddu, supari, and small Ganesha idol
**₹501 Package ($6)**: Complete offering with multiple sweets, fruits, flowers, and blessed items

You can also bring your own offerings like modaks, coconuts, and flowers. Outside vendors sell fresh flowers for ₹20-50 ($0.25-0.60), but temple prasad ensures proper sanctification.

Special abhishek (ritual bathing) services cost ₹1,100-5,100 ($13-61) depending on the ceremony type. Book these services in advance through the temple office.

## Accommodation Near Siddhivinayak Temple

Prabhadevi and nearby Dadar offer multiple stay options. Hotel Kohinoor Continental (₹4,500-6,000/$54-72 per night) sits 1 km from the temple with good amenities. Budget travelers find decent rooms at Hotel Sai International (₹2,500-3,500/$30-42 per night) within walking distance.

For more upscale options, check our [Mumbai accommodation guide](/mumbai/where-to-stay-mumbai/) covering areas like Bandra and Worli, both 15-20 minutes from the temple. Many devotees prefer staying in these areas for better dining and transport connectivity.

## Food Options Around the Temple

SK Bole Road and surrounding lanes offer numerous dining choices. Bharat Lunch Home serves authentic Maharashtrian thalis for ₹200-350 ($2.40-4.20). Hotel Abhishek specializes in South Indian breakfast items like dosa and idli for ₹80-150 ($0.95-1.80).

Street vendors outside the temple sell fresh coconut water (₹30-50/$0.35-0.60) and seasonal fruits. Avoid eating immediately before visiting if you plan to participate in rituals, as some ceremonies require fasting.

For broader Mumbai food experiences, consider joining organized [food tours](/mumbai/food-tours/) that often include temple areas and local specialties in their itineraries.

## Temple Rituals and Special Days

Daily aarti happens at 6:30 AM, 12:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. The evening aarti draws the largest crowds, creating an electric atmosphere with devotional singing and drum beats. Arrive 30 minutes early to secure good viewing spots.

Ganesh Chaturthi (August/September) transforms the temple into celebration central. Crowds multiply tenfold, and special programs run throughout the 11-day festival. Plan [how many days you need in Mumbai](/mumbai/how-many-days-mumbai/) around these major festivals if spiritual experiences interest you.

Sankashti Chaturthi (monthly Ganesha fasting day) also sees heavy crowds, though not as intense as Tuesdays or Ganesh Chaturthi.

## Planning Your Visit

Allocate 2-4 hours for your temple visit, including travel time and queuing. Combine your trip with nearby attractions like Shivaji Park or Worli Sea Face, both within 15 minutes of the temple.

First-time Mumbai visitors should include Siddhivinayak in their spiritual itinerary alongside other [Mumbai attractions](/mumbai/). The temple represents authentic local devotion while remaining accessible to tourists seeking genuine cultural experiences.
