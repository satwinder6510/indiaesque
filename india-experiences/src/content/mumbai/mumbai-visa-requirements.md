**Most foreign nationals need a visa to enter Mumbai, India. The e-Tourist visa is the most convenient option, available for 30, 90, or 365 days with fees ranging from $25-$100 depending on your nationality and duration.**

Planning your trip to Mumbai starts with getting the right visa. The process has become much simpler with India's digital visa system, but you still need to plan ahead and have the correct documents ready.

## E-Tourist Visa Options

The e-Tourist visa covers most travelers visiting Mumbai for tourism, casual business meetings, or medical treatment. You can choose from three durations:

**30-day e-Tourist visa**: Single or double entry, costs $25-$40 depending on nationality
**90-day e-Tourist visa**: Multiple entry allowed, costs $40-$80 
**365-day e-Tourist visa**: Multiple entry with 90-day stay per visit, costs $80-$100

Americans pay $100 for all durations due to reciprocal arrangements. British citizens pay $130 for the one-year visa. Check the official Indian visa portal for your specific nationality rates.

The 90-day option works best for most tourists planning to explore Mumbai thoroughly, giving you time for [heritage walks](../heritage-walks/), [food tours](../food-tours/), and visits to the city's [best markets](../markets/).

## Application Process and Timeline

Apply online through the official Government of India e-visa portal at indianvisaonline.gov.in. Never use third-party sites that charge extra fees.

The standard processing time is 4-7 business days, but applications can take longer during peak seasons (October-March) or if additional documentation is required. Apply at least two weeks before your travel date.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Fill out the online application form
2. Upload required documents 
3. Pay the visa fee online
4. Wait for email confirmation with your e-visa
5. Print the e-visa document for immigration

You receive your visa via email as a PDF. Print two copies - one for departure and one for arrival in Mumbai.

## Required Documents

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from your arrival date in Mumbai. You also need:

- Recent passport-style photograph (white background, 2x2 inches)
- Confirmed round-trip flight tickets
- Hotel reservations or invitation letter if staying with friends
- Bank statements showing sufficient funds (minimum $50 per day)
- Travel itinerary outline

For business visas, you need an invitation letter from the Indian company you're visiting, including their registration details and purpose of visit.

Upload clear, high-resolution scans of all documents. Blurry photos cause application delays or rejections.

## Visa Fees by Nationality

Visa fees vary significantly based on your passport country due to reciprocal agreements:

**Most European countries**: $25-$80 depending on duration
**United States**: $100 for all durations  
**United Kingdom**: $25 (30-day), $40 (90-day), $130 (365-day)
**Canada**: $25-$80
**Australia**: $25-$100
**Japan**: $25-$80

These fees are non-refundable, even if your visa application is rejected. Double-check your application before submitting.

## Airport Arrival Procedures

Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport has dedicated e-visa counters for international arrivals. The process typically takes 15-30 minutes during normal hours.

Present these documents to immigration:
- Printed e-visa copy
- Passport
- Return flight ticket
- Hotel booking confirmation

Immigration officers may ask about your travel plans, so be prepared to discuss your itinerary. Having your [Mumbai transport guide](../transport/) and hotel address ready speeds up the process.

The airport provides free WiFi if you need to access booking confirmations on your phone. Currency exchange counters are available after immigration if you need Indian rupees immediately.

## Embassy and Consulate Information

If you need a regular tourist visa or face e-visa issues, contact the nearest Indian embassy or consulate. Major locations include:

**Indian Embassy Washington DC**: +1-202-939-7000
**Indian High Commission London**: +44-20-7836-8484  
**Indian Consulate New York**: +1-212-774-0600
**Indian Consulate Toronto**: +1-416-960-0751

Regular visa processing takes 10-15 business days and requires an in-person appointment or postal application. E-visas remain the faster option for most tourists.

## Special Considerations

Pakistan and Chinese nationals cannot apply for e-visas and must use regular visa procedures through embassies. This process takes 3-4 weeks minimum.

If you're arriving by cruise ship or overland from Nepal or Bhutan, different visa rules apply. E-visas only work for airport and selected seaport arrivals.

Business travelers attending conferences or meetings longer than 90 days need business visas, not tourist visas. The application process requires more documentation but allows longer stays.
