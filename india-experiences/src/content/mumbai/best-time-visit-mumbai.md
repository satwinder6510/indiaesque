**October to March is the best time to visit Mumbai. These months offer cool, dry weather with temperatures around 20-30°C and minimal rainfall, perfect for exploring the city's attractions and outdoor markets.**

Mumbai's climate revolves around three distinct seasons, and timing your visit correctly makes the difference between a comfortable trip and a sweaty, rain-soaked ordeal. The city maintains a fairly consistent temperature of 30°C year-round, but humidity and rainfall vary dramatically.

## Peak Season: October to March

This six-month window delivers Mumbai at its finest. Temperatures drop to a comfortable 20-25°C at night, while daytime highs rarely exceed 32°C. Humidity levels decrease significantly from the oppressive 90% during monsoons to a bearable 60-70%.

December through February represents the absolute sweet spot. You can walk around Colaba Causeway or explore the [best markets in Mumbai](/mumbai/markets/) without breaking into a sweat every five minutes. Hotel prices peak during this period - expect to pay ₹4,000-8,000 ($48-96) per night for decent accommodations compared to ₹2,000-4,000 ($24-48) during off-season.

Flight prices from Delhi or Bangalore increase by 30-40% during peak months. Book at least two months ahead to secure reasonable rates of ₹8,000-12,000 ($96-144) for domestic flights.

## Monsoon Season: June to September (Avoid)

Mumbai receives over 200 centimeters of rainfall during these four months, with July being particularly brutal. The city's drainage system, built for a much smaller population, fails regularly. Areas like Dadar, Kurla, and parts of Andheri flood within hours of heavy rainfall.

Local trains - Mumbai's lifeline - stop running when water levels rise. The Western and Central railway lines shut down completely during severe flooding, stranding millions of commuters. If you're planning [heritage walks in Mumbai](/mumbai/heritage-walks/) or [food tours](/mumbai/food-tours/), forget about it during monsoon season.

The city transforms into a soggy, humid mess with 90% humidity levels. Temperatures hover around 28-32°C, but the moisture makes everything feel much hotter and stickier.

## Summer Season: April to May

These two months test your heat tolerance. Daytime temperatures reach 35°C with humidity levels climbing toward monsoon season peaks. The combination creates a suffocating atmosphere, especially in crowded areas like Crawford Market or Mohammed Ali Road.

However, summer brings advantages for budget travelers. Hotel rates drop by 40-50%, and you'll find excellent deals on flights. Attractions remain open with normal hours, unlike during monsoons when many outdoor spots close.

If you visit during summer, plan indoor activities during peak heat hours (11 AM to 4 PM). Shopping malls like Phoenix Mills or Palladium Mall offer air-conditioned relief.

## Festival Considerations

Mumbai's festival calendar impacts both weather experience and crowd levels. Ganesh Chaturthi, the city's biggest celebration, falls in August or September - right during monsoon season. While the festival energy is incredible, navigating flooded streets to reach celebration sites becomes challenging.

Diwali (October/November) coincides with perfect weather. The city lights up spectacularly, and the cool, clear air enhances the festive atmosphere. Hotel prices spike during Diwali week, so book early.

Navratri celebrations in September or October offer another festival experience during ideal weather conditions. Dance venues like NSCI Club in Worli host elaborate events under clear skies.

## Planning Your Mumbai Visit

Factor in your activities when choosing travel dates. Beach visits to Juhu or Marine Drive work best during cool months when sea breezes feel refreshing rather than humid. The [Mumbai transport system](/mumbai/transport/) operates more reliably during dry months, making it easier to navigate between neighborhoods.

Consider spending [multiple days in Mumbai](/mumbai/how-many-days-mumbai/) during peak season when weather won't limit your exploration options. The comfortable temperatures allow for full-day itineraries without weather-related interruptions.
