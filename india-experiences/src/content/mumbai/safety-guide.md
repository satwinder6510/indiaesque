  - question: "Is Mumbai safe for tourists?"
    answer: "Yes. Mumbai is one of India's safest major cities. The main concerns are pickpockets on crowded trains, taxi overcharging, and standard travel precautions. Violent crime against tourists is rare. South Mumbai feels cosmopolitan and secure."
  - question: "Is street food safe in Mumbai?"
    answer: "Generally yes. Mumbai's street food culture is robust and turnover is high. Stick to busy stalls, freshly cooked items, and famous vendors. Avoid pre-cut fruit and quiet stalls. Vada pav, pav bhaji, and dosa from busy vendors are safe."

## Solo Female Travel

### The Reality

Mumbai is safer than most Indian cities for solo women. The cosmopolitan culture, active nightlife, and mixed crowds make it more comfortable. Women work late, go out alone, and use public transport.

### Recommendations

- Use Uber/Ola at night — share ride details
- Local trains have women's compartments (use them)
- Avoid empty train compartments after 10 PM

**Accommodation:**
- Stay in South Mumbai, Bandra, or Juhu
- Read reviews from solo female travellers
- Hostels like Zostel have good reputations

**General:**
- Trust instincts
- South Mumbai feels safe late
- Bandra Linking Road has women out late
- Juhu Beach fine until 10 PM

### Areas to Avoid Alone at Night

- Empty local trains (especially late night)
- Isolated areas anywhere
- Streets behind train stations
