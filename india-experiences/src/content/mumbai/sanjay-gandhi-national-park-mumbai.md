**Sanjay Gandhi National Park is a 104 square kilometer urban wildlife sanctuary in Mumbai housing over 35 leopards, ancient Kanheri Caves, and offering lion safari experiences. Entry costs ₹44 ($0.50) for adults, with the best visiting time being October to March.**

Located in Borivali, this massive green lung of Mumbai spans across the northern suburbs and stands as one of the largest parks within city limits globally. You can reach the park via Borivali railway station on the Western Line, followed by a short auto-rickshaw ride.

## Wildlife and Safari Experiences

The park's main attraction is its thriving leopard population - over 35 leopards roam these forests, making it one of the few places where you can potentially spot big cats within a major city. The leopards are mostly active during dawn and dusk, so plan your visit accordingly.

The lion safari operates in a separate 20-hectare enclosure and costs ₹75-100 ($0.90-1.20) per person. The safari runs every 30 minutes from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM, except on Wednesdays when the park is closed. You'll see Asiatic lions in a semi-natural habitat during this 20-minute bus ride.

For a more relaxed experience, take the toy train that winds through the park's interior forests. The train costs ₹15 ($0.18) for adults and ₹10 ($0.12) for children, operating every hour from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

## Kanheri Caves: Ancient Buddhist Heritage

Inside the park, you'll find the Kanheri Caves - a complex of 109 Buddhist rock-cut caves dating from 1st century BCE to 10th century CE. The caves entry fee is ₹25 ($0.30) for Indian citizens and ₹300 ($3.60) for foreign tourists.

The caves sit atop a hill requiring a 45-minute uphill walk or a shared jeep ride for ₹20 ($0.24) per person. Cave 3 is the largest and most impressive, featuring intricate carvings and a massive prayer hall. The site offers panoramic views of Mumbai's skyline and the Arabian Sea.

## Practical Information and Entry Details

Entry to Sanjay Gandhi National Park costs ₹44 ($0.50) for adults, ₹25 ($0.30) for children (5-12 years), and ₹300 ($3.60) for foreign tourists. The park opens at 7:30 AM and closes at 6:30 PM daily except Wednesdays.

Vehicle entry costs extra: ₹110 ($1.30) for four-wheelers and ₹35 ($0.42) for two-wheelers. However, walking is often the best option as it increases your chances of wildlife spotting.

The park has multiple gates, but the main Borivali gate offers the easiest access to most attractions. From here, you can access the information center, toy train station, and safari booking counter.

## Best Time to Visit and What to Bring

October to March offers the most comfortable weather conditions with temperatures ranging from 20-30°C (68-86°F). The monsoon season (June to September) transforms the park into a lush green paradise, but heavy rains can restrict access to certain areas.

Visit early morning for the best wildlife experience - the park opens at 7:30 AM when animals are most active. Bring water bottles, comfortable walking shoes, and binoculars for bird watching. The park has over 250 bird species, including hornbills, kingfishers, and sunbirds.

Photography is allowed throughout the park, but flash photography is prohibited near wildlife. Mobile phone networks work well throughout most areas of the park.

## Getting There and Planning Your Visit

Take the Western Railway to Borivali station, then catch an auto-rickshaw or bus to the park's main gate (₹30-50 or $0.36-0.60 for auto). The journey from Central Mumbai takes 45-60 minutes by train.

Plan to spend 4-6 hours to cover the main attractions including the safari, caves, and nature trails. If you're planning a longer stay in Mumbai, consider how this fits into your [overall Mumbai itinerary](/mumbai/how-many-days-mumbai/). The park makes an excellent day trip and provides a complete contrast to Mumbai's urban experiences.

For accommodation, staying in [Borivali or nearby suburbs](/mumbai/where-to-stay-mumbai/) gives you easy access to the park, though most visitors come as a day trip from other parts of Mumbai.
