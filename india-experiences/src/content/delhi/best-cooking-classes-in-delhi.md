**Delhi cooking classes range from ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60) per person and come in three formats: home kitchen experiences with local families, professional culinary workshops, and market-tour-plus-cooking combos where you shop for ingredients before cooking them.** Most sessions last 3-5 hours, teach 3-5 dishes, and include eating what you've made.

## Home Cooking Experiences

These are the most popular format and often the most rewarding. A local host invites you into their home kitchen, teaches you family recipes, and you eat together at their dining table.

**What to expect:** You'll arrive at a home in a Delhi neighbourhood (often South Delhi — Defence Colony, GK, or Hauz Khas area). The host walks you through their spice box, explains the base techniques of Indian cooking (tempering spices, making masala pastes), and guides you through cooking 3-5 dishes from scratch.

**Typical menu:** Dal tadka, a vegetable dish (aloo gobi or palak paneer), rice, roti or paratha, and a sweet like kheer or halwa. Non-veg options typically include butter chicken, chicken curry, or keema.

**Cost:** ₹2,000-3,500 ($24-42) per person for 3-4 hours including the meal.

**Group size:** Usually 2-6 people. Many hosts accommodate solo travellers too.

The best part of home cooking classes is the conversation. You learn about daily life in Delhi, food traditions, and family recipes that don't appear in cookbooks. Several hosts on platforms like Airbnb Experiences and Withlocals have 4.9+ ratings for good reason.

## Market Tour + Cooking Combos

These combine a guided visit to a local market with a cooking session, which gives you context for the ingredients you're about to use.

**How it works:** You meet your guide at a neighbourhood market — often **INA Market** (near INA metro on the Yellow Line), **Sarojini Nagar Market**, or a market in Old Delhi. You walk through the vegetable, spice, and meat sections, learn about ingredients, and buy what you'll cook. Then you head to a kitchen (either the guide's home or a rented cooking studio) and prepare the meal.

**Why it's worth it:** Walking through INA Market's spice section with someone who can explain every pile of ground powder transforms how you understand Indian food. You see whole spices being ground, smell the difference between kashmiri chilli and regular chilli, and understand why Indian cooking starts with "heat oil, add cumin seeds."

**Cost:** ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) per person for 4-5 hours including market tour, cooking, and meal.

## Professional Cooking Workshops

For a more structured experience, several culinary schools and professional kitchens in Delhi offer half-day workshops.

**Academy of Culinary Education** in South Delhi runs hands-on workshops focused on North Indian cuisine, including tandoor cooking if you want to learn bread-making in a clay oven.

**Cost:** ₹3,500-5,000 ($42-60) per person for half-day workshops. Some offer multi-day programmes for serious cooks.

These workshops tend to be more technique-focused than home cooking classes — you'll learn proper knife work, how to balance a masala, and the science behind why certain spice combinations work.

## What You'll Actually Learn

Regardless of which format you choose, a good Delhi cooking class teaches these fundamentals:

**Spice tempering (tadka/tarka):** Heating whole spices in oil or ghee to release their flavour before adding other ingredients. This is the foundation of almost every Indian dish.

**Masala preparation:** Grinding and combining spices — understanding the difference between garam masala, chaat masala, and kitchen-specific masala blends.

**Bread making:** Rolling and cooking roti on a tava, or stuffing and frying parathas. This takes practice, and your first few rotis will be ugly. That's normal.

**Gravy bases:** The onion-tomato-ginger-garlic base that forms the backbone of most North Indian curries. Once you learn this, you can make dozens of dishes.

## How to Choose

**Pick a home cooking class if:** you want a personal, cultural experience and to learn home-style food that restaurants don't serve.

**Pick a market + cooking combo if:** you're a serious home cook who wants to understand ingredients, not just follow recipes.

**Pick a professional workshop if:** you want structured technique training and plan to cook Indian food regularly at home.

For all three types, book through your [Delhi experience provider](/delhi/experiences/) or check platforms with verified reviews. Book at least 3-4 days ahead, especially during peak tourist season (October to March).

## Pairing With Other Food Experiences

A cooking class pairs well with a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) — do the food tour first to taste the dishes, then take a cooking class to learn how to make them. You'll also better appreciate the [range of Delhi's food scene](/delhi/what-food-is-delhi-famous-for/) once you understand the spice work behind it.

## How Much Does a Cooking Class Cost in Delhi?

Home cooking experiences run ₹2,000-3,500 ($24-42) per person for a 3-4 hour session including a meal. Professional cooking workshops at culinary schools cost ₹3,500-5,000 ($42-60) for a half-day. Market tour plus cooking combos, where you shop for ingredients in a local market before cooking, cost ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) and take 4-5 hours total.

## What Dishes Will I Learn to Cook?

Most classes teach 3-5 dishes in a single session. Common menus include butter chicken or paneer tikka, dal makhani or dal tadka, rice (jeera rice or biryani), a bread (roti, naan, or paratha), and a dessert like gulab jamun or kheer. Vegetarian menus are standard — you'll typically choose between a veg or non-veg track when booking.

## Do I Need Cooking Experience to Take a Class in Delhi?

No. Most Delhi cooking classes are designed for beginners with zero Indian cooking experience. Instructors explain spices from scratch, demonstrate techniques step by step, and let you work at your own pace. You'll chop, grind, temper spices, and cook everything yourself with guidance. The home kitchen format is particularly beginner-friendly.
