  - question: "How hot does Delhi get in summer?"
    answer: "Delhi regularly hits 43-47°C (109-117°F) between mid-May and mid-June. April averages 38-42°C, and even March can reach 35°C by month's end. The heat is dry and intense — direct sun feels physically aggressive. Night temperatures stay above 28-30°C, offering little relief. The worst stretch is typically the last two weeks of May and first two weeks of June, before monsoon arrives in late June or early July."
  - question: "Is it worth visiting Delhi in summer?"
    answer: "Yes, if you plan around the heat. Hotels drop rates by 30-50%, tourist sites are nearly empty, and you skip the winter pollution. The key is staying indoors from 11am-4pm and scheduling outdoor visits for early morning only. Museums, cooking classes, malls, and Kingdom of Dreams are all fully air-conditioned. Budget travellers benefit most — a ₹12,000/night winter hotel room might cost ₹6,000-7,000 in May."

**Delhi in summer means temperatures above 40°C from April through June, so every worthwhile activity either happens before 9am or inside air conditioning.** It's the city's low season for a reason, but if you end up here during the hot months, you can still have a genuinely good time --- and save a lot of money doing it.

Summer in Delhi is divided into two phases: the dry heat of April to mid-June (40-47°C, low humidity, relentless sun) and the pre-monsoon period in late June (slightly cooler but with oppressive humidity). Both demand the same strategy: outdoor plans at dawn, indoor plans all day, outdoor options again after sunset.

## Why Summer Is Actually Cheap

Delhi's tourism drops sharply from April onwards. That translates directly to your wallet:

- **Hotel rates fall 30-50%.** A well-reviewed four-star hotel that charges ₹10,000-12,000 ($120-145) per night in winter often drops to ₹5,000-7,000 ($60-85) in May. Five-star properties in Aerocity and Chanakyapuri offer packages with spa credits and meal inclusions that don't exist in peak season.
- **Flights are cheaper.** Domestic routes to Delhi from Mumbai, Bangalore, and Kolkata drop noticeably in April-June.
- **No crowds.** Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and Qutub Minar --- all sites that draw long queues in winter --- are near-empty on summer mornings. You'll have the monuments practically to yourself.
- **Restaurant reservations.** That table at Indian Accent you need to book a week ahead in January? Available same-day in May.

For more on costs, see our [Delhi budget guide](/delhi/is-delhi-expensive/).

## Early Morning Outdoor Window

If you want to see Delhi's outdoor monuments, the window is roughly **6:00am to 9:00am**. After that, the sun becomes punishing and stone surfaces radiate heat.

### What Works Before 9am

**Lodhi Gardens:** Opens at sunrise. The park is surprisingly cool in early morning shade, and the tombs catch beautiful first light. Enter from Jor Bagh metro (Yellow Line). Be out by 9am.

**Humayun's Tomb:** Opens at sunrise. Entry ₹35 Indians / ₹600 foreigners. The sandstone glows in morning light and the gardens are dew-covered. You'll share it with joggers and photographers rather than tour groups.

**Qutub Minar:** Opens at 7am. The complex is compact enough to cover in 60-90 minutes. The iron pillar and carved galleries are worth the early alarm. Entry ₹35 Indians / ₹600 foreigners.

After 9am, retreat to air conditioning. This isn't optional --- heatstroke is a real risk. Carry a water bottle, wear a hat, and apply sunscreen even for short outdoor stretches.

## Indoor Attractions

### Museums

Museums are purpose-built for summer survival. All are fully air-conditioned and open by 10am. See our [museum guide](/delhi/best-museums-in-delhi/) for the full list, but the highlights:

- **National Museum** (Janpath) --- Free for Indians, ₹650 for foreigners. 2-3 hours of Mughal miniatures, Harappan artefacts, and textile galleries.
- **National Gallery of Modern Art** --- ₹20 Indians / ₹500 foreigners. Indian art from the 1850s onwards. 1.5-2 hours.
- **National Science Centre** --- ₹80 adults / ₹40 children. Interactive exhibits, great for families. 2-3 hours.
- **National Rail Museum** --- ₹100 adults. Vintage locomotives and a miniature train ride. Partially outdoor, so visit first thing in the morning. 1.5-2 hours.

### Cooking Classes

An air-conditioned kitchen for 3-4 hours, learning to make North Indian dishes, and eating everything you cook at the end. It's one of the smartest ways to spend a summer afternoon in Delhi.

Classes run ₹2,500-4,500 ($30-55) per person and cover 4-5 dishes --- dal makhani, chicken tikka, biryani, naan, raita. Several operators run from home kitchens in South Delhi neighbourhoods like Hauz Khas and Defence Colony. See our [cooking class guide](/delhi/best-cooking-classes-in-delhi/) for recommendations.

### Kingdom of Dreams --- Gurgaon

A fully air-conditioned entertainment complex in Gurgaon (now Gurugram), about 30 minutes from central Delhi by metro. The main draw is **Nautanki Mahal**, an auditorium staging Bollywood-style musical theatre shows --- think elaborate sets, live singing, choreographed dance numbers, and production values that rival West End shows.

**Show tickets:** ₹1,500-3,500 ($18-42) depending on seating.
**Getting there:** HUDA City Centre metro (Yellow Line), then auto-rickshaw or cab.

The complex also houses **Culture Gully**, an indoor street lined with regional food stalls from across India. It's a good dinner option before or after the show.

### Shopping Malls

Delhi's malls are social infrastructure in summer --- locals treat them as climate-controlled public spaces.

**Select Citywalk (Saket):** The best overall mall. International brands, PVR cinema, strong food court. Connected to Saket metro (Yellow Line). Behind it, **Champa Gali** has independent cafes worth an evening visit once the sun drops.

**DLF Mall of India (Noida):** India's largest mall by area. If you have kids, **KidZania** (₹1,000-1,500 per child) keeps them occupied for 3-4 hours. Blue Line metro to Noida Sector 18.

**Ambience Mall (Vasant Kunj):** Good mid-range shopping, a Snow World indoor snow park (₹500-700, fun for kids), and a large food court.

## Water Parks

When indoor activities run out, water parks offer the most logical outdoor option.

**Worlds of Wonder (Noida):** The closest quality water park to central Delhi. Slides, wave pools, and a lazy river. Entry ₹1,000-1,500 ($12-18). Open 10:30am-6:30pm. Take the Blue Line to Noida Sector 18, then auto. Go on weekdays --- weekend queues are long.

**Appu Ghar (Gurgaon):** Water zone and amusement rides. Entry ₹800-1,200 ($10-14.50). Smaller than Worlds of Wonder but closer if you're staying in South Delhi or Gurgaon. Huda City Centre metro, then cab.

Apply waterproof sunscreen --- you'll burn faster than you expect, even in water.

## What to Pack for Summer

For packing specifics, check our [Delhi packing guide](/delhi/what-should-i-pack-for-delhi/), but the summer essentials:

- **Loose, light-coloured cotton clothing.** Linen works well. Avoid dark colours and synthetic fabrics.
- **SPF 50+ sunscreen.** Reapply every 2 hours if outdoors.
- **Wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.** Non-negotiable.
- **Reusable water bottle.** Drink 3-4 litres per day minimum. Dehydration creeps up fast.
- **Electrolyte sachets.** Available at any pharmacy for ₹10-20 per packet. Add to water throughout the day.
- **Light scarf or stole.** Useful for temple visits and as sun protection.

## Evening Options

After 6pm, temperatures drop enough to sit outdoors --- not comfortably, but tolerably. Summer evenings in Delhi still hover around 35-38°C, but the lack of direct sun makes a difference.

**Rooftop dining in Connaught Place** works after sunset. The restaurants along the outer circle open terraces from 7pm. Cocktails and dinner at Unplugged Courtyard or Lord of the Drinks with the CP skyline lit up.

**Dilli Haat at INA** stays open until 10pm. The open-air craft market is bearable after dark, and the food stalls from different Indian states are a full dinner option. Entry ₹30. INA metro (Yellow/Pink Line).

**India Gate at night.** The monument is floodlit until midnight, and the surrounding lawns fill with families and ice cream vendors after dark. It's free, open, and one of the few outdoor spaces that works in summer --- after 8pm.
