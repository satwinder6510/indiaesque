faq:
  - question: "What are the most common scams in Delhi?"
    answer: "The top scams are: fake tourist offices near New Delhi Railway Station selling overpriced tours, taxi drivers claiming your hotel is closed to redirect you, gem/carpet shop hustles where someone befriends you, and unsolicited guides at monuments demanding payment. Avoid by ignoring unsolicited help and booking through apps."
  - question: "Which areas of Delhi are safe at night?"
    answer: "South Delhi (Defence Colony, GK, Hauz Khas), Connaught Place inner circle, Khan Market area, and Aerocity are well-lit with steady foot traffic. Avoid Old Delhi lanes, Paharganj, and areas around ISBT Kashmere Gate after 9 PM."
  - question: "Is street food safe in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, if you choose wisely. Eat where locals queue. Look for high turnover stalls where food is cooked fresh. Avoid pre-cut fruit and raw salads. Stick to fully cooked, served-hot items. The busier the stall, the fresher the food."
  - question: "Is Delhi polluted?"
    answer: "Yes, especially October to February when AQI often exceeds 300. Bring N95 masks. Check AQI on IQAir app daily. Avoid outdoor exercise on bad days. South Delhi generally has better air quality than North Delhi. Air purifiers run in most good hotels."
  - question: "Is it safe to take Uber at night in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Uber and Ola are safe at night — better than street taxis. Share your ride details with someone, verify the car's plate number, sit in the back, and use the SOS button if needed. Avoid auto rickshaws late at night."

Delhi is safe for tourists who take basic precautions. The main risks aren't crime — they're scams, traffic, and occasionally air pollution. Here's what to watch for and how to handle it.

## Avoiding Scams

Delhi's tourist circuit has well-rehearsed cons that catch first-time visitors. All rely on the same trick: someone approaches with unsolicited help that has a hidden cost.

### The Fake Tourist Office

Near **New Delhi Railway Station** (Gate 1 and 2), signs advertise "Government Tourist Office" or "Official Tourism Bureau." These are private agencies selling overpriced packages and fake tickets.

**Reality:** The real Government of India Tourist Office is at 88 Janpath, near Connaught Place — not at the station.

### The "Hotel Is Closed" Trick

Taxi/auto drivers tell you your hotel burned down, is closed, or has a strike — then take you to a commission-paying hotel instead.

**Fix:** Use Uber/Ola (GPS-tracked routes). Call your hotel before leaving the airport. Insist on going to your actual booking.

### Gem and Carpet Shop Scam

A friendly person strikes up conversation near India Gate or CP, then invites you to their "uncle's shop" for special prices on jewellery or carpets.

**Fix:** If conversation steers toward shopping, walk away. Genuine friendliness doesn't come with a destination.

### Unsolicited Monument Guides

At Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and Jama Masjid, people attach themselves to you for a "free tour" then demand ₹500-1,000.

**Fix:** Say "no, thank you" firmly. Book guides through your hotel if you want one.

### Auto Rickshaw Overcharging

Drivers near tourist spots quote ₹300-500 for ₹50-100 rides.

**Fix:** Use Uber Auto or Ola Auto for fixed app pricing. Or agree on exact fare before sitting down, and walk away from monuments before flagging one.

### General Rules

1. Ignore anyone who approaches you first near tourist areas
2. Book through apps or your hotel
3. Know approximate prices (metro ₹10-60, auto ride ₹50-150)
4. Never hand over your passport except at hotel check-in
5. The more eager someone is to help, the more likely there's commission involved

## Night Safety

### Safe Areas After Dark

**South Delhi:** Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Hauz Khas, and Saket stay active until 11 PM. Well-lit, wider streets, police presence.

**Connaught Place:** Inner circle has restaurants and bars open late. The N-M block area has nightlife until closing.

**Khan Market:** Shops close by 9:30 PM but restaurants stay open. Surrounding roads are patrolled.

**Aerocity:** Near airport. Modern, heavily secured, feels more Singapore than Delhi.

### Areas to Avoid at Night

**Old Delhi:** Chandni Chowk and lanes around Jama Masjid shut down by 8-9 PM. Alleys get dark and empty.

**Paharganj:** Main bazaar stays somewhat active but side lanes are sketchy — poor lighting, aggressive touts.

**ISBT Kashmere Gate:** Chaotic and uncomfortable after dark.

**Yamuna riverbank:** Isolated and unlit.

### Night Safety Tips

- Use Uber/Ola, not street taxis
- Share live location on WhatsApp
- Stick to main roads, avoid empty parks
- Trust your instincts — if a street feels wrong, turn around

## Street Food Safety

Delhi's street food is legendary and mostly safe if you're smart about it.

### What's Safe

- **High-turnover stalls** — long queues mean fresh food
- **Cooked-to-order items** — parathas, kebabs, chaat made fresh
- **Busy breakfast spots** — Sita Ram Diwan Chand, Paranthe Wali Gali
- **Anything served piping hot**

### What to Avoid

- Pre-cut fruit from street vendors (washed in tap water)
- Raw salads at basic restaurants
- Ice at street stalls (restaurant ice is fine)
- Stalls with no visible customers
- Anything sitting out for a long time

### Minimising Risk

- Start with cooked food, work up to chaat
- Be extra careful first 2-3 days while gut adjusts
- Carry ORS sachets from any pharmacy
- See our [practical travel tips](/delhi/practical-travel-tips/) for water safety

## Air Pollution

### The Reality

Delhi's air quality is poor, especially **October to February** when AQI regularly exceeds 300 (hazardous). November is typically worst due to crop burning season.

### Practical Steps

**Check AQI daily:** Use the IQAir app. Under 100 is acceptable. Over 200, limit outdoor time. Over 300, wear a mask outdoors.

**Bring N95 masks:** Available at pharmacies but quality varies. Bring a few from home.

**Choose South Delhi:** Generally better air quality than North Delhi due to more green spaces.

**Hotel air purifiers:** Most 3-star and above hotels run purifiers in rooms. Ask when booking.

**Avoid outdoor exercise:** Don't go jogging when AQI is high. Use hotel gyms instead.

### Best Months for Air Quality

March to June has better air (but hot weather). July-September (monsoon) washes pollution away but brings humidity. October onwards deteriorates.
