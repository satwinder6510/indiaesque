faq:
  - question: "Which areas of Delhi are safe at night?"
    answer: "South Delhi neighbourhoods like Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, and Hauz Khas are well-lit and have steady foot traffic after dark. Connaught Place's inner circle stays busy until 11 PM with restaurants and bars. Khan Market closes by 10 PM but the surrounding roads are patrolled. Aerocity near the airport is modern and heavily secured."
  - question: "Which areas should I avoid at night in Delhi?"
    answer: "Avoid the narrow lanes of Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazaar) after 9 PM — shops close early and the alleys get dark and empty. Paharganj near New Delhi Railway Station gets rough after dark with aggressive touts and poor lighting. Isolated stretches along the Yamuna, areas around ISBT Kashmere Gate, and poorly lit parts of North Delhi are best avoided."
  - question: "Is it safe to take an Uber at night in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Uber and Ola are safe options at night and much better than hailing a street taxi. Share your ride details with someone, sit in the back seat, and verify the car's number plate matches the app. Both apps have an SOS button and trip-sharing features. Avoid auto-rickshaws late at night as meters are rarely used and routes can be unpredictable."

**Parts of Delhi are perfectly safe at night, but the city varies wildly block by block.** South Delhi, Connaught Place, and Khan Market are well-patrolled, lit up, and have enough people around after dark. Other areas empty out fast once shops close, and that's where you need to be more careful.

## Where You Can Go After Dark

### South Delhi

This is where most expats and wealthier Delhiites live, and it shows. **Defence Colony**, **Greater Kailash (GK1 and GK2)**, **Hauz Khas**, and the area around **Saket** stay active well into the evening. Restaurants and cafes in these neighbourhoods are open until 11 PM or midnight. The streets are wider, better lit, and there's regular police presence.

**Khan Market** — Delhi's poshest market strip — shuts its shops by 9:30 PM, but restaurants like Big Chill and Perch stay open until 11 PM. The surrounding Lutyens' Delhi roads are quiet but well-patrolled by security since this is where politicians live.

### Connaught Place

The inner circle of CP has restaurants, bars, and the Odeon and Rivoli cinema complexes keeping things busy until 11 PM or later on weekends. **The block between N and M blocks** on the outer circle has most of the nightlife — places like Unplugged Courtyard and Lord of the Drinks pull crowds until closing time. Rajiv Chowk metro station (right underneath CP) runs until 11 PM.

Stick to the inner and middle circles. The radial roads leading away from CP — especially towards Minto Road and Barakhamba — get quieter and less comfortable after 10 PM.

### Aerocity

If you're staying near the airport, Aerocity's Worldmark complex is a bubble of chain hotels, restaurants, and bars that feels more Singapore than Delhi. It's heavily secured with private guards and CCTV. Perfectly safe at any hour, though it lacks any real local character.

## Where to Be Careful

### Old Delhi After Dark

Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazaar, and the lanes around Jama Masjid are electric during the day but shut down by 8-9 PM. Once the shops pull their shutters, the narrow alleys get genuinely dark and empty. The few people still around tend to be sleeping rough or loitering. There's no reason to wander these lanes at night unless you're with a guide doing a specific night food tour — and even then, you'll stick to the main roads near the mosque where a handful of kebab shops stay open late.

### Paharganj

The backpacker strip opposite New Delhi Railway Station has a reputation, and it's mostly earned. After dark, the main bazaar road stays somewhat active, but side lanes get sketchy — poor lighting, aggressive touts, and reports of petty theft are common. If you're staying in Paharganj, get back to your hotel before it gets too late and don't wander the back alleys. Read our guide on [whether Paharganj is worth staying in](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/) for more on this.

### Other Areas to Avoid

The area around **ISBT Kashmere Gate** (the inter-state bus terminal) is chaotic and uncomfortable at night. Stretches along the **Yamuna riverbank** are isolated and unlit. Parts of **North and East Delhi** farther from main roads don't have great infrastructure or lighting.

## Practical Safety Tips for Nighttime

**Use ride-hailing apps, not street taxis.** Uber and Ola track your route, share your trip with contacts, and have SOS buttons. Street taxis and autos at night often refuse meters and can take roundabout routes. Having an Indian SIM card for the OTP verification makes this easier — pick one up at the [airport when you arrive](/delhi/how-do-i-get-from-delhi-airport-to-the-city/).

**Share your location.** WhatsApp's live location feature works well. Share it with a friend or family member whenever you're moving around after dark.

**Stay on main roads.** Even in safe neighbourhoods, cutting through empty parks or unlit side streets isn't smart. Delhi's main arterial roads — Aurobindo Marg, Mathura Road, Ring Road — are busy with traffic at all hours.

**Trust your instincts.** If a street feels wrong, turn around. Delhi rewards caution more than bravado.

**Women travelling solo should take extra precautions.** Our separate guide on [whether Delhi is safe for solo female travellers](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-solo-female-travellers/) covers this in detail. The short version: stick to South Delhi and CP, use apps for transport, and avoid being alone on quiet streets after 10 PM.

## Which Areas of Delhi Are Safe at Night?

South Delhi neighbourhoods like Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, and Hauz Khas are well-lit and have steady foot traffic after dark. Connaught Place's inner circle stays busy until 11 PM with restaurants and bars. Khan Market closes by 10 PM but the surrounding roads are patrolled. Aerocity near the airport is modern and heavily secured.

## Which Areas Should I Avoid at Night in Delhi?

Avoid the narrow lanes of Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazaar) after 9 PM — shops close early and the alleys get dark and empty. Paharganj near New Delhi Railway Station gets rough after dark with aggressive touts and poor lighting. Isolated stretches along the Yamuna, areas around ISBT Kashmere Gate, and poorly lit parts of North Delhi are best avoided.

## Is It Safe to Take an Uber at Night in Delhi?

Yes. Uber and Ola are safe options at night and much better than hailing a street taxi. Share your ride details with someone, sit in the back seat, and verify the car's number plate matches the app. Both apps have an SOS button and trip-sharing features. Avoid auto-rickshaws late at night as meters are rarely used and routes can be unpredictable.
