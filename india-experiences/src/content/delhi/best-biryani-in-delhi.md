  - question: "What style of biryani is served in Delhi?"
    answer: "Delhi serves primarily two styles: Lucknowi (also called Awadhi or pakki biryani), where the rice and meat are cooked separately then layered and finished together; and Hyderabadi (kacchi biryani), where raw marinated meat is layered with partially cooked rice and slow-cooked in a sealed pot. Most Old Delhi restaurants serve the Lucknowi style. Some restaurants also serve a Delhi-specific version that's spicier and less subtle than the Lucknowi original."
  - question: "How much does biryani cost in Delhi?"
    answer: "Street-side and small restaurant biryani costs ₹150-300 ($2-3.60) per plate. Mid-range restaurants like Al Jawahar charge ₹250-450 ($3-5.50). Delivery services like Biryani By Kilo charge ₹350-600 ($4-7). Fine dining biryani at places like Dum Pukht at ITC Maurya runs ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36) per serving."
  - question: "Is Delhi biryani different from Hyderabad biryani?"
    answer: "Yes. Delhi biryani tends to follow the Lucknowi tradition — lighter, more fragrant, with meat and rice cooked separately before layering. Hyderabadi biryani uses the kacchi method, layering raw marinated meat with rice and cooking everything together in a sealed pot, producing a more intense flavour. Delhi's version is subtler; Hyderabad's is bolder."

**The best biryani in Delhi is found at Al Jawahar opposite Jama Masjid for an affordable, authentic Mughlai plate, at Dum Pukht inside ITC Maurya for a luxury slow-cooked experience, and through Biryani By Kilo if you want quality biryani delivered to your hotel.** Delhi isn't Hyderabad — biryani isn't the city's defining dish — but the Mughal legacy here means the biryani tradition runs deep, and several places do it exceptionally well.

## Understanding Delhi's Biryani Styles

Before you eat, it helps to know what you're ordering. Delhi sits at the crossroads of three biryani traditions.

### Lucknowi (Pakki) Biryani

This is the dominant style in Old Delhi. The meat (usually mutton or chicken) is cooked separately in a spiced gravy until tender. The rice is parboiled separately with whole spices — bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, mace. Then the two are layered in a heavy pot, sealed with dough, and slow-cooked (dum) so the flavours merge. The result is lighter and more aromatic than Hyderabadi biryani, with each grain of rice distinct and the meat falling off the bone.

### Hyderabadi (Kacchi) Biryani

Raw marinated meat is layered directly with partially cooked rice and sealed in a pot. Everything cooks together from scratch, so the meat juices infuse the rice more aggressively. The flavour is more intense, the rice stickier, the spicing heavier on chilli and saffron. A few Delhi restaurants serve this style, particularly those catering to Hyderabadi expats.

### Delhi-Style Biryani

Some Old Delhi establishments have developed their own variation — spicier than Lucknowi, with more green chilli and a darker colour from fried onions (birista). It's not officially codified the way Hyderabadi or Lucknowi biryani is, but regulars at places like Babu Bhai in Zakir Nagar will tell you it's its own thing.

## Where to Eat Biryani in Delhi

### Al Jawahar — Opposite Jama Masjid, Old Delhi

If you eat biryani at one place in Delhi, make it Al Jawahar. This restaurant sits directly across from Jama Masjid's main gate, and the upper-floor tables have a clear view of the mosque — something its more famous neighbour Karim's can't offer.

The **mutton biryani** here is Lucknowi-style: fragrant, light, with generous chunks of mutton cooked until the meat separates from the bone with a gentle pull. The rice is properly layered with saffron-stained grains on top. Each serving is substantial — enough for one hungry person or two moderate eaters sharing other dishes.

**Cost:** ₹300-450 ($3.60-5.50) per plate. **When:** Open 7 AM to 11 PM daily. Go before 12:30 PM or after 2:30 PM to avoid the lunch rush. **Getting there:** Walk from Jama Masjid Metro (Violet Line), or take a cycle rickshaw from Chandni Chowk Metro (Yellow Line).

### Dum Pukht — ITC Maurya, Diplomatic Enclave

The polar opposite of Al Jawahar in every way except quality. Dum Pukht is a formal fine-dining restaurant inside one of Delhi's most prestigious hotels. The chef here follows the Awadhi (Lucknowi) tradition precisely — the biryani pot is sealed with dough and slow-cooked for hours.

The **biryani dum pukht** uses long-grain Basmati from the Dehradun foothills, mutton from Rajasthan, and a spice mix that's lighter on chilli and heavier on saffron than anything you'll find in Old Delhi. When the sealed pot arrives at your table and the waiter breaks the dough seal, the steam that escapes is genuinely aromatic.

**Cost:** ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36) per serving. **Reserve:** Essential, at least 2-3 days ahead for dinner. **Dress code:** Smart casual. No shorts or flip-flops.

### Biryani By Kilo — Delivery across Delhi (and multiple outlets)

This chain has solved a genuine problem: getting good biryani delivered to your hotel without the quality collapsing during transit. Each order is cooked and delivered in individual sealed handis (clay pots), so the biryani arrives in the same vessel it was cooked in. The **Hyderabadi mutton biryani** is their strongest offering — properly layered, good saffron distribution, tender meat.

**Cost:** ₹350-600 ($4-7) per handi, depending on size and protein. **Order:** Through their app or Zomato/Swiggy. Delivery takes 45-60 minutes.

This is a practical option if you're staying in South Delhi or Gurgaon and don't want to travel to Old Delhi just for biryani.

### Karim's — Near Jama Masjid, Old Delhi

Karim's is more famous for its kebabs and Mughlai gravies than its biryani, but the **mutton biryani** deserves a mention. It's heavier and more oil-forward than Al Jawahar's version — a sturdier, more muscular biryani that's filling in a way that demands a post-meal walk through the lanes of [Old Delhi](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/).

**Cost:** ₹300-500 ($3.60-6) per plate. The original Jama Masjid location (near Gate 1) is the one that matters — the franchise branches elsewhere in Delhi vary in quality.

### Babu Bhai — Zakir Nagar

Zakir Nagar, near Jamia Millia Islamia university, is Delhi's under-explored biryani belt. Babu Bhai serves a Delhi-style biryani that's spicier and more robust than the Old Delhi restaurants. The rice is cooked with more green chilli and the birista (crispy fried onions) layer is thick and sweet.

**Cost:** ₹200-350 ($2.40-4) per plate. **Getting there:** Auto-rickshaw from Jamia Millia Metro (Magenta Line). The area isn't on the typical tourist circuit, but that's part of the appeal.

### Jawahar — Near Jama Masjid (Different from Al Jawahar)

Don't confuse this with Al Jawahar. Jawahar (no "Al") is a separate restaurant in the Matia Mahal lane behind Jama Masjid. Their chicken biryani is a solid budget option — less refined than Al Jawahar, but satisfying and cheap.

**Cost:** ₹200-300 ($2.40-3.60) per plate.

## The Biryani Order: What to Know

**Mutton is the default.** When someone in Delhi says "biryani" without specifying the meat, they mean mutton (goat meat). Chicken biryani exists everywhere but is considered the secondary option. If you want the full experience, order mutton.

**Raita is essential.** A side of cooling yoghurt with cucumber or boondi (fried chickpea flour drops) is the standard accompaniment. Most restaurants include it automatically; if they don't, order it. The richness of the biryani needs the counterbalance.

**Salan matters.** A mirchi ka salan (spicy chilli gravy) served alongside biryani is more of a Hyderabadi tradition, but some Delhi restaurants offer it. At Biryani By Kilo, it comes standard with Hyderabadi orders.

**Don't order biryani at a restaurant that specialises in something else.** Delhi has thousands of restaurants, and many put biryani on the menu because it sells, not because they can cook it well. Stick to places where biryani is a core menu item.

## Best Time to Eat Biryani in Delhi

Biryani is a lunch dish in Delhi. Most of the restaurants listed above prepare their biryani fresh for the midday service, and the best pots go first. At Al Jawahar, the mutton biryani can sell out by 2 PM on busy days. Evening service often uses reheated biryani from the lunch batch, which is still good but not at the same level.

During Ramadan (the month varies — check the Islamic calendar for 2026), the Old Delhi biryani restaurants serve special iftar platters after sunset that include biryani, kebabs, and haleem. This is one of the best eating experiences in Delhi, but expect significant crowds around Jama Masjid.

## Biryani on a Food Tour

Several [Delhi food tours](/delhi/food-tours/) include biryani stops in their Old Delhi routes. A guided food walk through the lanes near Jama Masjid typically costs ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36) per person and includes 6-8 tastings, with biryani often featured alongside kebabs, parathas, and sweets. This is a good way to try biryani at places you might not find on your own.
