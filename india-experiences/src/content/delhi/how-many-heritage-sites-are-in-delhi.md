**Delhi has 174 monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and 3 UNESCO World Heritage Sites — more heritage sites than any other city in India.** That count doesn't even include the hundreds of unprotected ruins, colonial-era buildings, and neighbourhood shrines scattered across the city.

## Why Delhi Has So Many Heritage Sites

The number makes sense when you consider that Delhi has been continuously inhabited for over 2,500 years. Seven distinct cities were built here by successive dynasties — Rajputs, Sultanates, Mughals, and the British — and each one left its monuments behind. Unlike many world capitals that demolished the old to build the new, Delhi just kept expanding outward.

The result is a city where a 12th-century minaret stands a few kilometres from a 17th-century fort, which is a metro ride away from a 20th-century colonial parliament. The [seven cities of Delhi](/delhi/what-are-the-7-cities-of-delhi/) stretch from Mehrauli in the south to Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) in the north, and the heritage sites map almost exactly onto these historic zones.

## The Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites

Delhi's three UNESCO sites are the headline attractions, and for good reason:

**Red Fort (Lal Qila)** — Designated in 2007. Shah Jahan's massive sandstone fortress in Old Delhi, built 1638-1648. This is where India's Prime Minister raises the national flag every Independence Day. Entry is ₹35 ($0.40) for Indians, ₹500 ($6) for foreigners. Closed Mondays.

**Humayun's Tomb** — Designated in 1993. Built in 1570, this is the garden tomb that directly inspired the Taj Mahal 83 years later. It's in Nizamuddin East, and the surrounding complex includes over 100 smaller tombs. Entry is ₹35/₹550.

**Qutub Minar Complex** — Designated in 1993. A 73-metre victory tower built in 1192 by Qutub-ud-din Aibak, surrounded by mosque ruins, the mysterious iron pillar, and the unfinished Alai Minar. Located in Mehrauli, South Delhi. Entry is ₹35/₹550.

## Beyond the Big Three

The 174 ASI-protected monuments are just the official count. Hundreds more sites are maintained by the Delhi government, private trusts, or nobody at all. Some of the most interesting heritage sites in Delhi are the ones that barely get visitors:

**Mehrauli Archaeological Park** has over 200 structures from the 10th to 19th century spread across an overgrown forest — Balban's Tomb, Jamali Kamali Mosque, Rajon ki Baoli. Free entry, almost no tourists.

**Lodhi Gardens** contains 15th-century tombs of the Sayyid and Lodhi dynasties set in manicured gardens. Free entry. Delhi's best morning walk.

**Feroz Shah Kotla** (Firozabad ruins) near ITO has a 3rd-century BC Ashokan pillar and the crumbling remains of the fifth city of Delhi. Entry is ₹35/₹300.

**Purana Qila** (Old Fort) near Pragati Maidan may sit on the site of Indraprastha, the legendary Pandava capital from the Mahabharata. Entry is ₹35/₹300.

**Agrasen ki Baoli**, a 14th-century stepwell in the middle of Connaught Place, is free to enter and one of Delhi's most photogenic structures.

## How to See Delhi's Heritage Sites

You have three main approaches:

**Guided heritage walks** are the best way to understand what you're looking at. INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) runs weekend walks that cover specific areas in depth — Old Delhi, Mehrauli, Lodhi Road. Prices range from ₹500-2,500 ($6-30) per person. Check out our [heritage walks guide](/delhi/heritage-walks/) for current schedules and booking details.

**Self-guided tours** work well if you're comfortable navigating by Google Maps. Download an offline map, pick a zone (Old Delhi, Mehrauli, or the Lodhi-Humayun's Tomb belt), and walk between sites. Most clusters are within 2-3 km of each other.

**Private car with driver** is the most efficient option if you're short on time. A full-day car rental costs ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) and lets you cover sites across multiple zones. Your driver won't be a guide, but they'll know where to park, which matters more than you think in Delhi.

## Can You Visit All of Delhi's Heritage Sites?

Not all 174 ASI-protected monuments are open to the public — some are in restricted zones or military areas. But you can easily visit 30-40 major sites across Old Delhi, Mehrauli, Lodhi Road, and New Delhi. A focused heritage tour over 3-4 days covers the most significant ones.
