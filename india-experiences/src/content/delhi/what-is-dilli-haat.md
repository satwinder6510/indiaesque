  - question: "What is Dilli Haat and is it worth visiting?"
    answer: "Dilli Haat is a government-run open-air crafts bazaar in South Delhi where artisans from every Indian state sell handicrafts, textiles, jewellery, and pottery at their own stalls. Entry is ₹30 ($0.35). It's absolutely worth visiting — you get access to regional crafts you'd otherwise need to travel across India to find, plus a food court with dishes from 20+ states."
  - question: "What can you buy at Dilli Haat?"
    answer: "Dilli Haat sells handloom textiles, block-printed fabrics, Kashmiri shawls, tribal jewellery, Rajasthani pottery, wooden carvings, leather goods, miniature paintings, papier-mâché items, brass utensils, and more. Stalls rotate every 15 days, so the selection changes regularly. Prices range from ₹100 for small items to ₹5,000+ for premium shawls or large artworks."
  - question: "How do I get to Dilli Haat?"
    answer: "The easiest route is the Yellow Line metro to INA station. Take Exit 1 and walk 2 minutes — Dilli Haat is directly opposite INA Market on Aurobindo Marg. By Uber or auto, search for 'Dilli Haat INA' to avoid confusion with the smaller Dilli Haat in Pitampura."

**Dilli Haat is an open-air crafts bazaar run by Delhi Tourism where artisans from every Indian state sell handicrafts, textiles, and regional food under one roof — all for a ₹30 ($0.35) entry fee.** It's the single most efficient place in Delhi to buy authentic Indian souvenirs without the chaos of Old Delhi's markets.

## What You'll Find Inside

The market is laid out as a series of open-air stalls arranged around a central courtyard, designed to look like a traditional Indian village market (haat). Each stall is run by artisans who come to Delhi on a rotating basis — vendors change every 15 days, which means the selection shifts regularly.

Typical stalls include:

- **Textiles and clothing** — Banarasi silk, Chanderi cotton, Lucknowi chikankari, Rajasthani bandhani, Gujarati mirror-work
- **Jewellery** — tribal silver from Odisha, lac bangles from Rajasthan, Kashmiri silver filigree
- **Pottery and ceramics** — Khurja pottery, blue pottery from Jaipur, terracotta from Bengal
- **Woodwork and carvings** — sandalwood from Karnataka, wooden toys from Channapatna, rosewood from Kerala
- **Paintings** — Madhubani from Bihar, Warli from Maharashtra, Pattachitra from Odisha, Mughal miniatures
- **Leather goods** — Rajasthani juttis (embroidered shoes), bags, wallets
- **Metalwork** — Bidriware from Hyderabad, Moradabad brassware, Dhokra tribal casting

Prices are lower than equivalent items in tourist shops or airport stores, though slightly higher than buying directly in the artisans' home states. A pair of Rajasthani juttis runs ₹300-800 ($3.60-9.60). Madhubani paintings start at ₹500 ($6). Pashmina shawls range from ₹2,000-10,000 ($24-120) depending on size and quality.

Light bargaining is acceptable at the craft stalls — ask for 10-15% off and you'll often get it, especially if you're buying several items. For more on negotiating, see our guide on [bargaining in Delhi markets](/delhi/is-bargaining-expected-in-delhi-markets/).

## The Food Court

The outer ring of Dilli Haat is a food court with stalls representing different Indian states. This is one of the few places in Delhi where you can eat Naga pork curry, Rajasthani dal baati churma, Gujarati thali, Kerala appam, Manipuri dishes, and Coorgi pandi curry in the same sitting.

Dishes cost ₹100-250 ($1.20-3). The quality is solid — not restaurant-level, but honest regional cooking. Food stall prices are fixed, so no bargaining here.

Don't miss the **kulfi** (Indian ice cream) stalls. The mango and pistachio flavours are particularly good.

## Practical Details

**Location**: Aurobindo Marg, opposite INA Market, South Delhi

**How to get there**: Yellow Line metro to **INA station**, Exit 1. Dilli Haat is a 2-minute walk across the road. By auto-rickshaw or Uber, search for "Dilli Haat INA" — there's a second, smaller Dilli Haat in Pitampura (North Delhi) that you don't want.

**Hours**: Open daily, 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM. No weekly closing day.

**Entry fee**: ₹30 ($0.35) for Indian nationals, ₹30 for foreign visitors. Children under 3 enter free.

**Time needed**: Budget 1.5 to 3 hours. An hour for crafts browsing, 30-60 minutes for food, and extra time if you get into conversations with artisans (which you will).

**Best time to visit**: Weekday afternoons are quietest. Weekend evenings get crowded, especially during festival season. October through March has the most pleasant weather for browsing outdoors.

## Dilli Haat vs. Other Markets

If you're deciding between Dilli Haat and other Delhi markets, here's how it compares:

**Dilli Haat vs. Chandni Chowk**: Chandni Chowk has more volume and lower prices but is overwhelming to navigate and requires serious bargaining. Dilli Haat is curated, calm, and easy to browse. If you want the full sensory experience, go to Chandni Chowk. If you want quality handicrafts without a headache, go to Dilli Haat.

**Dilli Haat vs. Janpath**: Janpath is faster and closer to Connaught Place, but sells more generic tourist goods. Dilli Haat's rotating artisan model means you're buying from the people who made the items.

**Dilli Haat vs. Government Emporiums**: The state emporiums on Baba Kharak Singh Marg have fixed prices and guaranteed quality, but the atmosphere is more like a department store. Dilli Haat feels like an actual market.
