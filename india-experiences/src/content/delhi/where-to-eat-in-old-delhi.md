  - question: "What are the must-eat restaurants in Old Delhi?"
    answer: "Karim's (mutton burra kebab, seekh kebab, since 1913), Al Jawahar (Mughlai food with a Jama Masjid view), Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala (yoghurt dumplings since the 1940s), and Paranthe Wali Gali shops (stuffed parathas since the 1870s). For sweets, Old Famous Jalebi Wala and Kuremal Kulfi Wale in Chawri Bazaar. Budget ₹200-500 per person at most spots."
  - question: "Is it safe to eat street food in Old Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, if you follow a few rules. Eat at stalls with high turnover — a crowd means fresh food. Avoid pre-cut fruit sitting in the open and skip anything with tap water ice. Stick to freshly cooked items. The busiest stalls in Chandni Chowk serve hundreds of people daily and maintain quality because their reputation depends on it."
  - question: "What time should I go to Old Delhi for food?"
    answer: "Go between 10 AM and 2 PM for the widest selection. Paranthe Wali Gali is best before 11 AM when the oil is freshest. Karim's and Al Jawahar are good from noon through evening. Many sweet shops and chaat stalls open by 10 AM. Avoid going during Friday afternoon prayers near Jama Masjid, as many shops close temporarily."

**The best eating in Old Delhi is at Karim's for kebabs, Paranthe Wali Gali for parathas, Al Jawahar for Mughlai food, and Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala for chaat — all within walking distance of each other in the Chandni Chowk area.** This is Delhi's oldest and most concentrated food district, where some shops have been cooking the same recipes for over a century.

## Getting There

Take the Yellow Line metro to **Chandni Chowk station**. Exit towards the main Chandni Chowk Road. Everything listed below is within a 15-minute walk, though navigating the lanes takes practice. A [guided food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) is genuinely useful here — the best stalls are often deep inside unmarked alleys.

## Karim's

**Location:** Gali Kababian, near Jama Masjid Gate 1
**Open:** 9 AM to midnight daily
**Cost:** ₹300-600 ($3.60-7) per person

Karim's has been serving Mughlai food since 1913. The restaurant started as a small stall and is now one of the most famous eating houses in India. The **mutton burra kebab** (large marinated mutton pieces grilled on charcoal) is the signature dish — rich, smoky, and genuinely excellent. The **seekh kebab** and **mutton korma** are also reliable.

Skip the biryani here (Al Jawahar does it better) and focus on the grilled meats. Seating is basic — shared tables in a noisy courtyard. Go for lunch to avoid the dinner rush.

## Al Jawahar

**Location:** Directly opposite Jama Masjid, Matia Mahal Road
**Open:** 7 AM to midnight daily
**Cost:** ₹250-500 ($3-6) per person

Al Jawahar serves similar Mughlai food to Karim's but with a view of Jama Masjid from the upper floor. Their **nihari** (slow-cooked meat stew, traditionally a breakfast dish) is arguably the best in Delhi — get there before 10 AM for it. The **mutton biryani** is well-spiced and generous. Less crowded than Karim's, slightly more comfortable seating.

## Paranthe Wali Gali

**Location:** Off Chandni Chowk Road, near Gurudwara Sis Ganj
**Open:** 8 AM to 10 PM daily
**Cost:** ₹60-120 ($0.70-1.50) per paratha plate

This narrow alley has 5-6 shops frying stuffed [parathas since the 1870s](/delhi/what-is-paranthe-wali-gali/). Classic fillings include aloo (potato), gobhi (cauliflower), and paneer. Adventurous options include rabri (sweetened milk), papad, and mixed dal. Each paratha comes with pickle and potato curry. Go before 11 AM when the oil is fresh and the queues are short.

## Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala

**Location:** Chandni Chowk main road, near the fountain
**Open:** 10 AM to 10 PM daily
**Cost:** ₹80-100 ($1-1.20) per plate

Running since the 1940s, Natraj serves what many consider Delhi's finest **dahi bhalle** — soft lentil dumplings in whipped yoghurt with tamarind and mint chutney. The **aloo tikki** here is also outstanding. It's a standing-only counter with no seating, and the staff moves fast. Point at what you want, pay, eat, leave.

## Old Famous Jalebi Wala

**Location:** Corner of Dariba Kalan and Chandni Chowk Road
**Open:** 8 AM to 9 PM daily
**Cost:** ₹60-80 ($0.70-1) per plate

A massive kadhai of oil sits at the front of the shop, and fresh jalebis are fried continuously all day. The sugar syrup crust should be crispy on the outside, soft inside. Eat them within five minutes of buying — they don't travel well.

## Kuremal Mohan Lal Kulfi Wale

**Location:** Kucha Pati Ram, Chawri Bazaar
**Open:** 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM (closed Sundays)
**Cost:** ₹60-120 ($0.70-1.50) per serving

Operating since 1906, this kulfi shop stuffs frozen kulfi inside real fruit shells — mango, apple, kiwi, orange. The **mango kulfi** and **paan kulfi** are the standouts. Chawri Bazaar metro station is the closest stop. The shop is small and easy to miss; ask anyone in the lane.

## Haji Shabrati Nihari Wale

**Location:** Near Chitli Qabar, Jama Masjid area
**Open:** 5 AM to 10 AM (breakfast only)
**Cost:** ₹150-200 ($1.80-2.40)

If you want authentic nihari — the slow-simmered breakfast stew of Mughal Delhi — this is the place. The pot starts cooking at midnight and is ready by dawn. Served with tandoori roti and a squeeze of lime. Get there early; they sell out by mid-morning.

## Eating Strategy for Old Delhi

Plan to spend 3-4 hours eating your way through the area. A sensible route: start at **Paranthe Wali Gali** for breakfast, walk to **Natraj** for dahi bhalle, continue to **Jama Masjid** area for kebabs at **Karim's** or **Al Jawahar**, and finish with jalebis and kulfi for dessert.

Don't try to do everything in one visit — your stomach has limits. The [Old Delhi food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) paces the eating well and includes 8-12 tastings across the neighbourhood.
