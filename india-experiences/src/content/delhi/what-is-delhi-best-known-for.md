**Delhi is best known for its layered Mughal architecture, its street food culture, and its status as the capital of virtually every major empire that has ruled northern India.** It's a city defined by the sheer density of its history and the intensity of its present.

Most cities have one identity. Delhi has about seven — literally. The area we now call Delhi has been the site of at least seven major cities built over more than a millennium. That layering is what makes it different from any other Indian destination.

## Mughal Architecture

The Mughals ruled from Delhi for centuries, and the monuments they left behind are the city's most recognisable landmarks.

**Red Fort (Lal Qila)** is the icon — the red sandstone fortress where India's Prime Minister raises the flag every Independence Day. Shah Jahan built it in the 1640s as the centrepiece of his new capital, Shahjahanabad (what we now call Old Delhi).

**Humayun's Tomb** predates the Taj Mahal by nearly a century and was the direct architectural template for it. The Persian-style Charbagh gardens and the red sandstone and marble dome sit in one of Delhi's most peaceful settings.

**Jama Masjid** is India's largest mosque, built by Shah Jahan in 1656. It holds 25,000 people and the view from the southern minaret spans the entire old city.

**Qutub Minar** is even older — a 72-metre victory tower dating to 1193 that marks the beginning of Muslim rule in India. The surrounding complex includes the Iron Pillar, which has resisted corrosion for over 1,600 years.

For a guided walk through these sites and the stories connecting them, check out Delhi's [heritage walks](/delhi/heritage-walks/).

## Seven Ancient Cities

Delhi isn't one city — it's at least [seven cities layered on top of each other](/delhi/what-are-the-7-cities-of-delhi/). The Tomars built Lal Kot in the 11th century. The Khiljis built Siri. The Tughlaqs built Tughlaqabad and Jahanpanah. Firoz Shah built Firozabad. The Mughals built Shahjahanabad. The British built New Delhi.

Each city left behind ruins, and those ruins are scattered across the modern metropolis. You can walk through the remains of Tughlaqabad Fort in South Delhi, then drive 20 minutes to stand in Shah Jahan's Mughal city, then walk another 10 minutes into Lutyens' British-designed government quarter.

This physical layering of history — visible on the same streets — is what makes Delhi unlike almost any other capital city.

## Street Food Capital

Delhi's street food reputation is earned. The city is ground zero for North Indian eating, and the food traditions here span centuries.

**Chandni Chowk** in Old Delhi is the epicentre. This single street and its branching lanes contain hundreds of food stalls, many of them multi-generational. You'll find:

- **Paranthe Wali Gali**: A narrow lane of shops frying stuffed paranthas in ghee since the 1870s
- **Natraj Dahi Bhalle**: Chaat stall operating since the 1940s
- **Old Famous Jalebiwalah**: Crispy jalebis fried to order, ₹60 ($0.70) per plate
- **Karim's**: Mughal-recipe kebabs and curries since 1913

Beyond Old Delhi, the food sprawls into every neighbourhood. **Moti Mahal** in Daryaganj claims to have invented butter chicken in the 1950s. **Rajouri Garden** and **Lajpat Nagar** have their own chaat cultures. Khan Market and Hauz Khas Village represent Delhi's modern restaurant scene.

A guided [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) through Old Delhi is the best way to navigate the overwhelming number of options — your guide will know which stall has the best nihari and which jalebi shop to avoid.

## Political Capital of India

Delhi has been the seat of political power in India for centuries, and that continues today. The city is home to:

- **Rashtrapati Bhavan**: The President's residence, designed by Edwin Lutyens with 340 rooms
- **Parliament House**: The circular Sansad Bhavan on Kartavya Path
- **India Gate**: The 42-metre war memorial that anchors the central ceremonial axis

The entire **Lutyens' Delhi** zone — the area around Kartavya Path, India Gate, and the government buildings — was purpose-built in the 1910s-1930s as the capital of British India. It's one of the most ambitious urban planning projects of the 20th century, and walking from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan gives you a direct sense of that imperial scale.

## Markets and Shopping

Delhi's markets are as diverse as the city itself. From wholesale bazaars that supply half of North India to boutique shopping streets, the range is enormous.

**Chandni Chowk** is the oldest and most chaotic — lanes specialise in specific goods: Kinari Bazaar for wedding supplies, Dariba Kalan for silver, Khari Baoli for spices (Asia's largest spice market).

**Sarojini Nagar** sells export surplus and factory reject clothing from international brands at ₹100-500 ($1.20-6) per item.

**Khan Market** is the upscale option — bookshops, restaurants, and international brands in a compact market dating to 1951.

**Dilli Haat** brings handicrafts from every Indian state into one open-air bazaar. Entry is ₹30 ($0.36).

## Cultural Hub

Delhi is India's cultural capital by volume. The city has more museums, galleries, live music venues, and theatres than any other Indian city. The **India Habitat Centre** and **National School of Drama** host performances year-round. **Nizamuddin Dargah** has live qawwali music every Thursday evening. During festival season — Diwali, Holi, Republic Day — the entire city transforms.
