  - question: "Can you climb Qutub Minar?"
    answer: "No. Climbing inside the tower has been banned since 1981, after a stampede during a school trip killed 45 people when the lights failed on the narrow interior staircase. You can walk around the base and examine the carvings up close, but you cannot enter. The ban is permanent and enforced strictly."
  - question: "How long do you need at Qutub Minar?"
    answer: "Plan 1 to 1.5 hours for the main complex. That gives you time for the Qutub Minar tower, the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque ruins, the iron pillar, Alai Darwaza, the unfinished Alai Minar, and Iltutmish's Tomb. If you also walk through the adjacent Mehrauli Archaeological Park, add another 45-60 minutes."
  - question: "What is the iron pillar at Qutub Minar?"
    answer: "A 7-metre, 6-tonne iron pillar dating to the 4th century AD (Gupta period), roughly 700 years older than the Qutub Minar itself. It has resisted corrosion for over 1,600 years, which metallurgists attribute to its high phosphorus content forming a protective passive layer. It was originally a flagstaff for a Vishnu temple and was moved to its current location. You can no longer touch it — a fence was installed in 1997."

**Yes, Qutub Minar is absolutely worth visiting — the 73-metre sandstone tower built in 1192 is one of the finest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture in the world, and the complex around it contains 800 years of layered history.** Go in the morning for the best light on the carvings, and combine it with the nearby Mehrauli Archaeological Park.

## What Makes It Worth the Visit

The Qutub Minar itself is the tallest brick minaret in the world — five storeys of tapering sandstone and marble, each decorated with different patterns of fluting, Arabic inscriptions, and geometric carvings. The detail on the first two storeys (built by Qutub-ud-din Aibak and Iltutmish between 1192 and 1220) is extraordinary. Bring binoculars or a zoom lens — you can't go inside, so the best way to appreciate the stonework is from the ground looking up.

But the tower is only part of the complex. The surrounding site packs an almost absurd density of historical structures into a small area:

**Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque** — India's oldest surviving mosque, built in 1192 using pillars and materials from 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples. Look closely and you'll see Hindu carvings (bells, chains, floral motifs) on the columns, topped with Islamic arches. It's one of the most striking examples of architectural reuse anywhere.

**The Iron Pillar** — A 7-metre iron column from the 4th century Gupta period, standing in the mosque courtyard for over 1,600 years without rusting. Scientists believe its high phosphorus content creates a passive protective film. A fence prevents touching, but you can get close enough to see the Sanskrit inscription dedicating it to Lord Vishnu.

**Alai Darwaza** — A magnificent gateway built in 1311 by Alauddin Khalji. The red sandstone and white marble, the pointed arches, and the lattice screens are some of the finest decorative stonework in Delhi. This small building is often overlooked but repays close attention.

**Alai Minar** — The 24-metre stump of a tower that Alauddin Khalji intended to build twice the height of the Qutub Minar. He died in 1316 and nobody bothered to continue. The unfinished base gives you a sense of the ambition.

**Iltutmish's Tomb** — The first Islamic tomb built on Indian soil (1235). The interior marble carving is deeply detailed, though the dome has collapsed.

## Best Time to Visit

**Morning, always morning.** The Qutub Minar faces east, and the rising sun lights up the carvings spectacularly between 7 and 9 AM. By midday the light is flat and in summer the site has limited shade.

**Weekday mornings** are significantly quieter than weekends. Arrive at opening (sunrise) and you'll have 30-60 minutes before the tour buses appear.

**October to February** is the ideal season. The light is warm, the air is cooler, and the gardens around the complex are green.

## Practical Details

- **Entry:** ₹35 ($0.40) for Indian nationals, ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign visitors
- **Hours:** Sunrise to sunset, daily
- **Metro:** Qutub Minar station (Yellow Line), then an 800-metre walk south along Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road
- **Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours for the main complex
- **Photography:** Free, no tripod restrictions. The symmetry of the tower against the mosque ruins is the classic shot
- **Guides:** Official ASI guides wait near the entrance — ₹300-500 ($3.60-6) for a 45-minute tour. Worth it for the history

## Combine It With Mehrauli

The [Mehrauli Archaeological Park](/delhi/what-is-mehrauli-archaeological-park/) is directly adjacent to the Qutub Minar complex — you can walk between them in 5 minutes. The park contains over 200 structures spanning the 10th to 19th centuries, spread across an overgrown forested area. Entry is free. It's one of Delhi's most fascinating and least visited heritage sites.

After the park, Mehrauli village itself has street food stalls and the Adham Khan's Tomb, a Mughal-era structure now surrounded by market shops. The village is one of Delhi's oldest continuously inhabited areas, dating back to the founding of Lal Kot in the 11th century.

For broader South Delhi coverage, see our guide to [things to do in South Delhi](/delhi/things-to-do-in-south-delhi/). The Qutub area works well as the first stop on a South Delhi day that continues to Hauz Khas, Lodhi Gardens, or Sunder Nursery.

Check our [heritage walks guide](/delhi/heritage-walks/) for the Mehrauli circuit walk, which connects Qutub Minar, the archaeological park, Jamali Kamali Mosque, and Balban's Tomb.

## Can You Climb Qutub Minar?

No. Climbing inside the tower has been banned since 1981, after a stampede during a school trip killed 45 people when the lights failed on the narrow interior staircase. You can walk around the base and examine the carvings up close, but you cannot enter. The ban is permanent and enforced strictly.

## How Long Do You Need at Qutub Minar?

Plan 1 to 1.5 hours for the main complex. That gives you time for the Qutub Minar tower, the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque ruins, the iron pillar, Alai Darwaza, the unfinished Alai Minar, and Iltutmish's Tomb. If you also walk through the adjacent Mehrauli Archaeological Park, add another 45-60 minutes.

## What Is the Iron Pillar at Qutub Minar?

A 7-metre, 6-tonne iron pillar dating to the 4th century AD (Gupta period), roughly 700 years older than the Qutub Minar itself. It has resisted corrosion for over 1,600 years, which metallurgists attribute to its high phosphorus content forming a protective passive layer. It was originally a flagstaff for a Vishnu temple and was moved to its current location. You can no longer touch it — a fence was installed in 1997.
