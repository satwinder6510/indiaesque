  - question: "What happens at Nizamuddin Dargah on Thursday?"
    answer: "Every Thursday evening, Sufi musicians perform qawwali — devotional songs — at the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. The performances typically start after the Maghrib (sunset) prayer, around 6-7 PM depending on the season, and can continue for two or more hours. The singers sit in a circle near the main tomb, and listeners gather around them on the marble floor. It's free, open to all faiths, and one of the most powerful live music experiences in Delhi. Arrive by 6 PM to get a good spot."
  - question: "Do you need to cover your head at Nizamuddin?"
    answer: "Yes. Both men and women should cover their heads when entering the dargah compound. Scarves and cloth caps are available for free or for a small donation (₹10-20) at stalls near the entrance. Women should also cover their arms and legs — a long scarf or dupatta over shoulders works well. Remove your shoes before entering the inner shrine area. These are signs of respect at any Sufi shrine in India, and the custodians will politely remind you if you forget."

**Nizamuddin is one of Delhi's oldest continuously inhabited neighbourhoods — a 700-year-old settlement built around the tomb of the Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, where you can hear live qawwali every Thursday evening, visit Humayun's Tomb next door, and eat kebabs that locals drive across the city for.** This is Delhi at its most layered, where medieval devotion and modern life occupy the same narrow lanes.

## Nizamuddin Dargah — The Sufi Shrine

The dargah (tomb-shrine) of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, a 14th-century Sufi saint, is the spiritual heart of this neighbourhood. Nizamuddin Auliya was a mystic whose teachings emphasised love and tolerance, and his shrine has drawn devotees — Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Christian — for over 700 years.

The shrine complex includes the marble-enclosed tomb of the saint, surrounded by the graves of notable followers including the poet Amir Khusrau (considered the father of qawwali music) and the Mughal princess Jahanara Begum (Shah Jahan's daughter).

### Visiting the Dargah

**Entry:** Free. Open daily from early morning to late evening. No ticket required.

**Etiquette:** Cover your head (both men and women). Scarves and caps are available at the entrance for free or a nominal ₹10-20. Remove shoes before the inner compound — there's a shoe counter at the entrance. Women should cover arms and legs. Photography is generally accepted in the outer courtyard but should be avoided inside the tomb chamber, especially during prayers.

**What to expect:** The atmosphere is intense — incense, rose petals on the marble tomb, devotees pressing their hands against the lattice screen, and the constant hum of prayers. It's not a tourist attraction in the traditional sense; it's an active place of worship. Be respectful, keep your voice low, and observe rather than intrude.

**Donations:** You'll be asked for donations (chaddar offerings, rose petals, incense) by attendants at the tomb. A donation of ₹50-100 is sufficient and not obligatory. Don't feel pressured.

## Thursday Evening Qawwali

This is the main event, and the reason many travellers time their Nizamuddin visit for a Thursday.

After the Maghrib (sunset) prayer — roughly 6-7 PM depending on the season — qawwali singers gather in a semicircle near the main tomb and perform devotional songs. The music builds from quiet, meditative phrases into full-throated, hypnotic crescendos with handclapping and harmonium. Some performances run for two hours or more.

**How it works:** There's no fixed stage or ticketed seating. Listeners sit on the marble floor around the performers. Arrive by 6 PM to get close. The performance starts organically — there's no announcement. When the singers begin, the crowd settles.

**Who can attend:** Everyone, regardless of faith. Foreign visitors are welcome. The atmosphere is inclusive, though overwhelmingly spiritual. This isn't a concert; it's devotional practice that happens to be extraordinary music.

**Tips:** Don't clap along or treat it like entertainment. Sitting quietly and listening is the appropriate response. If you're moved, a small offering placed in the collection cloth is appreciated. Our [Sufi music guide](/delhi/where-to-hear-live-sufi-music-in-delhi/) covers other qawwali venues in Delhi.

## Humayun's Tomb

A 10-minute walk from the dargah, Humayun's Tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the architectural predecessor to the Taj Mahal. Built in 1570, it was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent and introduced the Persian char-bagh (four-quartered garden) design that Shah Jahan later perfected in Agra.

**Entry:** ₹35 for Indian nationals, ₹600 (~$7) for foreign visitors. Open sunrise to sunset.

The red sandstone and white marble structure sits in meticulously restored gardens — the Aga Khan Trust spent years bringing both the tomb and its surrounding landscape back to their original design. The symmetry is remarkable, and the interior chambers contain dozens of cenotaphs of Mughal royals.

**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours. The gardens deserve a slow walk. Late afternoon light (4-5:30 PM) is best for photography.

For a detailed comparison with its more famous descendant, see our guide on [Humayun's Tomb vs the Taj Mahal](/delhi/humayuns-tomb-vs-taj-mahal/).

## Sunder Nursery

Connected to Humayun's Tomb complex via a newly opened gate, Sunder Nursery is a 90-acre heritage park restored by the Aga Khan Trust. It combines 16th-century Mughal monuments — small tombs and garden structures — with native plant gardens, water channels, and an amphitheatre for cultural events.

**Entry:** ₹35 for Indian nationals, ₹200 (~$2.50) for foreign visitors. Open 7 AM to 6 PM.

The nursery is beautifully maintained and rarely crowded. If you're visiting Humayun's Tomb, budget an extra 45 minutes to an hour to walk through Sunder Nursery on your way out. Birders visit early morning for migratory species around the water features.

## Nizamuddin Basti — Food

The lanes around the dargah form Nizamuddin Basti (settlement), and they're packed with food stalls and small restaurants serving Mughlai cooking that's been refined over generations.

**What to eat:**

- **Kebabs** — seekh kebabs and shami kebabs grilled over charcoal at stalls along the main lane. ₹60-120 for a plate.
- **Nihari** — a slow-cooked stew of bone marrow and spices, traditionally eaten for breakfast. Several shops in the basti serve it from early morning. ₹150-200 for a bowl with naan.
- **Biryani** — the Nizamuddin style uses mutton and is heavier on spices than the Hyderabadi version. ₹200-300 for a generous plate.
- **Phirni** — a cold, set rice pudding served in clay pots, topped with saffron and nuts. ₹50-80.

Eat at the stalls — they've been feeding pilgrims for decades and the turnover is fast, which means the food is fresh. For a guided experience, our [food tour guide](/delhi/food-tours/) lists operators who cover Nizamuddin.

## How to Get There

**By metro:** JLN Stadium station (Violet Line) is the closest, about a 15-minute walk to the dargah. The walk takes you through residential streets that aren't well-signed, so use Google Maps.

**By Uber/Ola:** This is easier, especially for evening qawwali visits. Drop-off at the Nizamuddin Basti entrance on Mathura Road. A ride from Connaught Place costs ₹200-300.

**By auto-rickshaw:** From nearby landmarks like India Gate or Khan Market, an auto costs ₹80-150. Use the Ola/Uber auto booking feature for fixed pricing.

## Best Way to Plan Your Visit

The most rewarding Nizamuddin visit combines Humayun's Tomb, Sunder Nursery, and the dargah in a single afternoon-to-evening trip:

1. **3:30 PM** — Start at Humayun's Tomb for afternoon light
2. **5:00 PM** — Walk through Sunder Nursery
3. **5:45 PM** — Head to Nizamuddin Dargah
4. **6:00-6:30 PM** — Settle in for Thursday qawwali (if it's Thursday)
5. **8:00 PM** — Eat kebabs and nihari in the basti lanes

On non-Thursday days, you can still visit the dargah — the atmosphere is calmer and you'll have more space to explore the tomb chambers. But the Thursday qawwali is the highlight and worth planning around. A [heritage walk](/delhi/heritage-walks/) covering this route with a guide adds historical context that's hard to get on your own.

## What Happens at Nizamuddin Dargah on Thursday?

Every Thursday evening, Sufi musicians perform qawwali — devotional songs — at the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. The performances typically start after the Maghrib (sunset) prayer, around 6-7 PM depending on the season, and can continue for two or more hours. The singers sit in a circle near the main tomb, and listeners gather around them on the marble floor. It's free, open to all faiths, and one of the most powerful live music experiences in Delhi. Arrive by 6 PM to get a good spot.

## Do You Need to Cover Your Head at Nizamuddin?

Yes. Both men and women should cover their heads when entering the dargah compound. Scarves and cloth caps are available for free or for a small donation (₹10-20) at stalls near the entrance. Women should also cover their arms and legs — a long scarf or dupatta over shoulders works well. Remove your shoes before entering the inner shrine area. These are signs of respect at any Sufi shrine in India, and the custodians will politely remind you if you forget.
