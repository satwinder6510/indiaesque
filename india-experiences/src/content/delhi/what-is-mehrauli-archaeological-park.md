  - question: "Is Mehrauli Archaeological Park safe to visit?"
    answer: "During daylight hours, yes. The park is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and has a caretaker at the entrance. Stick to the marked paths, and go before 4 PM in winter or 5:30 PM in summer. The park is mostly deserted on weekdays, so visiting with at least one other person is advisable. On weekends, you'll see a handful of photographers, history students, and walkers."
  - question: "How do I get to Mehrauli Archaeological Park?"
    answer: "The park entrance is on Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, about 200 metres south of the Qutub Minar complex. From Qutub Minar metro station (Yellow Line), walk south for 1 km — past the Qutub Minar complex entrance and continue along the road. You can also take an auto from the metro station for ₹20-30. If you're visiting Qutub Minar first, just walk out the back exit toward Mehrauli village."
  - question: "How long do you need at Mehrauli Archaeological Park?"
    answer: "Budget 1 to 1.5 hours for a proper walk through the main structures. If you're into photography or architecture, you could spend 2-3 hours here easily. The park is spread over several acres with paths winding through trees, so it takes time to find everything. Combine it with Qutub Minar for a half-day Mehrauli heritage outing."

**Mehrauli Archaeological Park is a sprawling heritage site containing over 200 monuments from the 10th to 19th century, spread across an overgrown forest immediately adjacent to the Qutub Minar complex.** Entry is free, it rarely gets more than a handful of visitors, and it contains some of the most architecturally significant structures in Delhi that almost nobody sees.

## What's Inside the Park

The park sits on land that was once the heart of Lal Kot — the first of Delhi's seven historic cities, built by the Tomar Rajputs in the 11th century. Over the following 900 years, successive rulers — Sultanate, Mughal, and British-era — kept building here, layering their monuments on top of and alongside the older ones.

The result is a place where you can walk 50 metres and cross three centuries. Here are the standout structures:

**Balban's Tomb (1287)** — The tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban is architecturally significant because it features the first true arch built on Indian soil. Before this, Indian builders used the corbelling technique (overlapping stones). Balban's Tomb introduced the radiating voussoir arch from Central Asia. The dome has collapsed, but the archways are intact and give you a clear look at this engineering breakthrough.

**Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb (1528-1536)** — The finest building in the park. The mosque is a late Sultanate / early Mughal structure with delicately carved stone screens and painted interior ceilings. The adjacent tomb of the Sufi poet Jamali has remnants of coloured tile and plaster decoration on the ceiling that rival the best work in the Qutub complex. Jamali's companion, Kamali, is buried beside him — their relationship is a matter of historical speculation.

**Rajon ki Baoli** — A large, five-storey stepwell that once served the settlement around Lal Kot. It's one of the most intact baolis in Delhi, with arched galleries on multiple levels descending to a pool. It's deeper and less restored than Agrasen ki Baoli, and the vegetation growing through the stones adds to its character.

**Quli Khan's Tomb (late 16th century)** — A Mughal-era tomb that was converted into a house by the British-era writer Thomas Metcalfe, who renamed it Dilkusha ("Heart's Delight"). The structure still has its Mughal dome, but you can see the colonial-era additions — windows, a verandah, and fireplaces — grafted onto the stone.

**Gandhak ki Baoli** — A Sultanate-era stepwell with sulphurous water (gandhak means sulphur). Smaller than Rajon ki Baoli but atmospheric, with arched corridors and a narrow descent.

**Dozens of unnamed tombs, walls, and gateways** — Many structures in the park are unidentified. You'll stumble on crumbling domes, broken arches, and partial walls without any signboard or explanation. This is part of the charm — you're walking through a thousand years of Delhi's history, and much of it hasn't been catalogued.

## Why Almost Nobody Visits

Mehrauli Archaeological Park is poorly signposted and has no real visitor infrastructure — no ticket counter, no audio guide, no cafe. The entrance is easy to miss on Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, marked by a small ASI sign. Most tourists visit the adjacent Qutub Minar complex and have no idea the park exists.

The overgrown setting also deters some visitors. Paths wind through trees and scrub, structures are partially hidden by vegetation, and in monsoon season the undergrowth is thick. It's not manicured like Lodhi Gardens — this is archaeology in a semi-wild state.

That's exactly why it's worth going. You'll be walking through ruins that predate the Qutub Minar with almost nobody else around. The silence, after the tour-bus noise of the Qutub complex, is striking.

## Visiting Details

- **Entry:** Free
- **Hours:** Sunrise to sunset, daily
- **Location:** Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, approximately 200 metres south of the Qutub Minar complex
- **Metro:** Qutub Minar station (Yellow Line), then 1 km walk south
- **Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours (longer if you photograph or sketch)
- **Best time:** Morning (7-10 AM) for light and cool temperatures. Weekdays for solitude

## Combining It With Qutub Minar

The natural pairing is [Qutub Minar](/delhi/is-qutub-minar-worth-visiting/) first (ticketed, 1-1.5 hours), then walk to the archaeological park (free, 1-1.5 hours). Together they make a 3-hour heritage morning in Mehrauli that covers 1,000 years of architecture.

After the park, walk into Mehrauli village for chai and street food. The village is one of Delhi's oldest continuously inhabited areas and has a local feel that's completely different from tourist-facing Delhi.

The Mehrauli circuit is one of the four main routes covered in our [heritage walks guide](/delhi/heritage-walks/). If you prefer a guided experience, INTACH runs occasional walks that connect Qutub Minar, the archaeological park, and the village. The guides know which unmarked structures are which — invaluable in a park where half the monuments have no signage.
