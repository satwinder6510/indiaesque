## Old Delhi: The Street Food Capital

Old Delhi's labyrinthine lanes around Chandni Chowk contain India's most legendary street food concentration. These aren't trendy pop-ups — many stalls have been family-run for generations.

### Paranthe Wali Gali

**What:** A narrow lane of paratha shops, each stuffing flatbreads with everything from potatoes to rabri (sweet milk).

**Where:** Off Chandni Chowk, near the Fatehpuri Mosque end

**Try:** Mixed stuffing parathas, served with curd and pickle

**Cost:** ₹80-150 per plate

**Hours:** 8 AM - 10 PM

The lane has been serving parathas since the 1870s. Tourist-heavy but still worth it for the experience.

### Karim's

**What:** Legendary Mughlai restaurant, founded 1913 by descendants of Mughal court chefs

**Where:** Gali Kababian, near Jama Masjid Gate 1

**Try:** Mutton burra kebab, chicken jahangiri, seekh kebabs, mutton korma

**Cost:** ₹300-600 for a meal

**Hours:** 9 AM - 12:30 AM

The original location has the atmosphere. Multiple branches exist but skip them.

### Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala

**What:** Chaat specialist, same recipe since 1940s

**Where:** Chandni Chowk main road, near Paranthe Wali Gali

**Try:** Dahi bhalle (lentil dumplings in yogurt), aloo tikki chaat

**Cost:** ₹60-100

**Hours:** 10 AM - 9 PM

The tangy, sweet, spicy layering defines Delhi chaat.

### Old Famous Jalebi Wala

**What:** Fried sweet spirals, served hot from the wok

**Where:** Corner of Dariba Kalan and Chandni Chowk

**Try:** Jalebis with rabri (thickened milk)

**Cost:** ₹50-80 per serving

**Hours:** 8 AM - 9 PM

Watch them fry fresh batches. Best eaten immediately while crispy.

## Butter Chicken: Born in Delhi

**Modern interpretations:**
