**India's Republic Day parade on 26 January is the most spectacular military and cultural display in Delhi — a 90-minute procession of tanks, missile systems, fighter jet flyovers, camel-mounted cavalry, and elaborate cultural floats rolling down Kartavya Path in the heart of the capital.** If you're in Delhi in late January, this is worth rearranging your schedule for.

Republic Day commemorates the adoption of India's constitution on 26 January 1950. It's a national holiday, and the parade is the centrepiece — broadcast live to over a billion viewers across India. Attending in person is a completely different experience from watching on television.

## What Happens During the Parade

The parade follows a route along Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath), the broad ceremonial avenue that runs from Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President's residence) to India Gate. Here's the sequence:

### The Opening Ceremony

The President of India arrives and takes the salute. If there's a visiting head of state (Republic Day always features a chief guest from another country), they arrive alongside the President. The national flag is unfurled and the national anthem is played.

### The Military Display

This is what draws the crowds. The three armed forces — Army, Navy, and Air Force — march in formation with their respective bands playing. Expect to see:

- **Infantry regiments** in full ceremonial dress, including some of the world's most decorated units
- **Mechanised columns** — tanks (T-90 Bhishma, Arjun MBT), armoured vehicles, and infantry fighting vehicles
- **Missile systems** — BrahMos cruise missiles, Akash air defence systems, and other strategic weapons mounted on mobile launchers
- **Mounted cavalry** — the President's Bodyguard regiment on horseback, and the Border Security Force's famous camel contingent from the Rajasthan border
- **The Navy and Coast Guard** with ship models and marine commandos
- **The fighter jet flyover** — typically the grand finale. Sukhoi Su-30MKIs, Rafale jets, and sometimes the Tejas light combat aircraft fly in formation over the parade route, trailing coloured smoke. This is the moment everyone waits for, and it's genuinely thrilling.

### Cultural Tableaux

Between military segments, each Indian state and union territory sends a float (called a tableau) showcasing its culture, heritage, and achievements. These are elaborate constructions — moving stages with dancers, musicians, and scale models of temples, forts, or natural landscapes. The tableaux competition is taken seriously; states spend months preparing their entries.

### School Children and NCC

Thousands of school children from across India perform choreographed routines — dances, gymnastic formations, and musical numbers. The National Cadet Corps (NCC) also marches. The parade ends with a motorcycle display by military riders performing daredevil stunts.

## Getting Tickets

Tickets for the Republic Day parade go on sale online through the Ministry of Defence portal at **aamantran.mod.gov.in**, usually starting in the first week of January. Here's what you need to know:

**Price**: ₹100-500 ($1.20-6) per ticket, depending on the block. The cheapest seats are furthest from the action but still offer decent views.

**Availability**: Tickets sell out quickly. Check the portal daily from 1 January onward. They typically release tickets in batches, so if it shows sold out, check again the next day.

**Foreign tourists**: Some embassies receive a small allocation of parade seats. Contact your embassy in Delhi in early January to ask. Otherwise, use the online portal like everyone else — you'll need an Indian mobile number to register.

**ID requirement**: Carry your passport on the day. Ticket holders must show photo ID matching their booking.

## Arriving on the Day

**Gates open**: 7:00 AM

**Recommended arrival**: 8:00 AM at the latest. Security screening is thorough and lines are long.

**Parade start**: Approximately 10:00 AM

**Parade end**: Approximately 11:30 AM

### What You Can't Bring

Security is airport-level strict. The following are prohibited:

- Large bags, backpacks, or suitcases
- Water bottles (only small water pouches are sometimes allowed)
- Cameras with large lenses (phone cameras are fine)
- Laptops, tablets, or electronic devices other than phones
- Food packets or tiffin boxes
- Umbrellas
- Any sharp objects

Carry as little as possible. Phone, wallet, ID — that's it. Wear warm layers (late January mornings in Delhi can be 3-5 degrees C) because you'll be sitting in the open for 3+ hours.

### Getting There

The metro is the best option. **Central Secretariat** and **Udyog Bhawan** stations on the Yellow and Violet lines are closest. However, some metro stations near the parade route close on the morning of 26 January for security. Check the DMRC website or app on 25 January for station closures.

Don't plan on taking a taxi or Uber to the venue — roads within a 3 km radius of Kartavya Path are closed from the early hours of 26 January.

## If You Don't Get Parade Tickets

The parade is televised live on all major Indian news channels starting at 9:30 AM. Many hotels have it playing in their lobbies. Watching on a big screen with commentary actually helps you understand what's happening, since the in-person experience can feel distant from the far seating blocks.

You can also watch the **Beating Retreat** ceremony on 29 January (three days after Republic Day) at Vijay Chowk, near Rashtrapati Bhavan. This is a military band performance at sunset — brass bands from the Army, Navy, and Air Force play in formation as the sun goes down. Tickets are available on the same portal and are easier to get than parade tickets. It's a beautiful event and some people prefer it to the parade itself.

## What Else Happens That Week

Republic Day isn't a single-day affair. The celebrations stretch across roughly a week:

- **24-25 January**: Rehearsals on Kartavya Path. You can sometimes watch these from a distance, and they give you a preview of the parade without the ticket hassle.
- **25 January**: National Voters' Day and cultural programmes at various venues.
- **26 January**: The main parade.
- **26 January evening**: Illumination of government buildings. Rashtrapati Bhavan, North and South Block, and India Gate are lit up spectacularly. Worth a drive or walk past after dark.
- **27-28 January**: Republic Day celebrations continue with performances at various Delhi venues.
- **29 January**: Beating Retreat at Vijay Chowk (sunset, approximately 5:30 PM).

## Practical Tips

- **Weather**: Late January is cold. Morning temperatures hover around 4-7 degrees C. Wear thermals, a warm jacket, and possibly gloves. By the time the parade ends around 11:30 AM, it warms to 15-18 degrees C.
- **Food and water**: Since you can't bring food or drink, eat a solid breakfast before leaving. You'll find vendors selling tea and snacks outside the security perimeter after the parade ends.
- **Photography**: Phone cameras work fine for the military hardware and flyover. The cultural tableaux pass close enough for good photos from most seating blocks.
- **Combine with other winter activities**: If you're in Delhi for Republic Day, you're in the city during peak [winter season](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-in-winter/). The weather is ideal for monument visits, and the city is at its most atmospheric. For a broader look at [what Delhi is best known for](/delhi/what-is-delhi-best-known-for/), check our overview.
