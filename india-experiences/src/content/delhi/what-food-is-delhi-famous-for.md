faq:
  - question: "What is the single most iconic Delhi dish?"
    answer: "Chole bhature is probably Delhi's most defining dish. It's spiced chickpea curry served with deep-fried puffed bread, eaten for breakfast or lunch. The best versions are at Sita Ram Diwan Chand in Paharganj (₹80 / $1 per plate) and Baba Nagpal Corner in Lajpat Nagar. Every neighbourhood has its own loyally defended favourite shop."
  - question: "Where did butter chicken originate?"
    answer: "Butter chicken was invented in Delhi in 1947 by Kundan Lal Gujral at Moti Mahal in Daryaganj. He repurposed leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato-cream-butter gravy. Moti Mahal still operates at its original location on Netaji Subhash Marg, and a plate costs around ₹350-450 ($4-5). Several restaurants claim the invention, but Moti Mahal's claim is the most widely documented."
  - question: "Is Delhi food mostly non-vegetarian?"
    answer: "Not at all. Delhi has a massive vegetarian food culture thanks to its large Punjabi, Marwari, and Jain communities. Dishes like chole bhature, aloo tikki, dahi bhalle, parathas, and rajma chawal are all vegetarian. Most restaurants in Delhi serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, and many are exclusively 'pure veg' — look for green signs on storefronts."

**Delhi is famous for chaat, chole bhature, parathas, kebabs, butter chicken, biryani, and jalebis — all of which taste better here than anywhere else in India.** This is a city that has absorbed food traditions from Mughal courts, Punjabi refugees, and traders from every corner of the subcontinent, and the result is one of the most serious eating cities in Asia.

## Chole Bhature

This is Delhi's desert-island dish. Spiced chickpea curry with deep-fried puffed bread, eaten for breakfast or lunch. The best versions are at **Sita Ram Diwan Chand** in Paharganj (₹80 / $1 per plate), where the line starts forming at 8 AM. **Baba Nagpal Corner** in Lajpat Nagar is the South Delhi answer. Every Delhiite has a strong opinion about whose chole bhature is best, and they're all convinced they're right.

## Chaat

Delhi's chaat game is unmatched. These tangy, spicy snack plates come in dozens of varieties — golgappe (hollow crisp shells filled with spiced water), aloo tikki (potato patties with chutneys), dahi bhalle (lentil dumplings in yoghurt), and papdi chaat. The best chaat in the city is arguably at **Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala** in Chandni Chowk, operating since the 1940s. A plate costs ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.20). For a proper tour of the chaat scene, a [guided food tour through Old Delhi](/delhi/food-tours/) is the fastest way to find the stalls that locals actually eat at.

## Parathas at Paranthe Wali Gali

[Paranthe Wali Gali](/delhi/what-is-paranthe-wali-gali/) is a narrow alley off Chandni Chowk that's been serving stuffed parathas since the 1870s. The fillings range from classic (aloo, gobhi, paneer) to unusual (rabri, papad, mixed dal). A paratha plate with pickle and curry runs ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.20). Go before 11 AM for the freshest oil and shortest queues.

## Kebabs

Delhi's kebab tradition comes straight from the Mughal kitchens. **Karim's**, in a lane near Jama Masjid's Gate 1, has been grilling seekh kebabs and mutton burra since 1913. A kebab platter costs ₹300-500 ($3.60-6). Their mutton Jahangiri is slow-cooked in spices and is genuinely outstanding. **Al Jawahar**, directly opposite Jama Masjid, does excellent kebabs too and is slightly less crowded. Read our full guide on [where to eat in Old Delhi](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/) for more options.

## Butter Chicken

Delhi invented butter chicken. In 1947, Kundan Lal Gujral at **Moti Mahal** in Daryaganj created the dish by simmering leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato-cream-butter gravy. Moti Mahal still stands on Netaji Subhash Marg, and a plate costs around ₹350-450 ($4-5). For the full origin story and where to eat the best versions today, see our [butter chicken guide](/delhi/what-is-butter-chicken-and-where-was-it-invented/).

## Biryani

Delhi's biryani style sits between the lighter Lucknowi dum biryani and the spicier Hyderabadi version. **Al Jawahar** near Jama Masjid does a reliable mutton biryani for ₹250-350 ($3-4). For a luxury version, **Dum Pukht** at ITC Maurya slow-cooks their biryani in sealed pots — expect to pay ₹1,800-2,500 ($22-30) per portion, but the flavour justifies it.

## Jalebis and Sweets

Old Delhi's jalebi is a category of its own. **Old Famous Jalebi Wala** in Chandni Chowk (near the Dariba Kalan crossing) fries fresh jalebis all day in a massive kadhai. A plate is ₹60-80 ($0.70-1). Get them hot — once they cool down, they lose half their magic. For rabri (thickened sweetened milk), the shops on Kinari Bazaar are excellent.

## Rajma Chawal and Home-Style Food

Not everything in Delhi is street food or Mughlai. **Rajma chawal** — kidney bean curry with rice — is Delhi's comfort food, eaten in every office canteen and home kitchen. The best commercial version is at **Rajma Chawal** in Rajouri Garden. A plate costs ₹100-150 ($1.20-1.80).

## What Is the Single Most Iconic Delhi Dish?

Chole bhature is probably Delhi's most defining dish. It's spiced chickpea curry served with deep-fried puffed bread, eaten for breakfast or lunch. The best versions are at Sita Ram Diwan Chand in Paharganj (₹80 / $1 per plate) and Baba Nagpal Corner in Lajpat Nagar. Every neighbourhood has its own loyally defended favourite shop.

## Where Did Butter Chicken Originate?

Butter chicken was invented in Delhi in 1947 by Kundan Lal Gujral at Moti Mahal in Daryaganj. He repurposed leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato-cream-butter gravy. Moti Mahal still operates at its original location on Netaji Subhash Marg, and a plate costs around ₹350-450 ($4-5). Several restaurants claim the invention, but Moti Mahal's claim is the most widely documented.

## Is Delhi Food Mostly Non-Vegetarian?

Not at all. Delhi has a massive vegetarian food culture thanks to its large Punjabi, Marwari, and Jain communities. Dishes like chole bhature, aloo tikki, dahi bhalle, parathas, and rajma chawal are all vegetarian. Most restaurants in Delhi serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, and many are exclusively 'pure veg' — look for green signs on storefronts.
