  - question: "Is November or February better for visiting Delhi?"
    answer: "Both are excellent, but they offer different experiences. November has warmer daytime temperatures (22-28 degrees C), Diwali celebrations, and post-monsoon greenery, but pollution can spike from mid-November. February is cooler (8-24 degrees C), has cleaner air, and the city's flowering trees start blooming. February edges ahead on air quality; November wins on festivals."
  - question: "What is Delhi weather like in October?"
    answer: "October in Delhi is warm but manageable — daytime highs around 33 degrees C (91F), dropping to 18 degrees C (64F) at night. The monsoon has just ended, so air quality is the best it will be all year. It's a good month to visit if you can handle some heat and want to avoid the peak-season crowds that start in November."
  - question: "Is December a good time to visit Delhi?"
    answer: "December has comfortable afternoon temperatures (18-22 degrees C) and almost no rain, making it pleasant for sightseeing. The downsides are cold mornings (4-7 degrees C), dense fog that can delay flights and trains, and poor air quality — Delhi's AQI regularly exceeds 300 in December. If pollution doesn't concern you and you pack warm layers, December works well."

**November and February are the two best months to visit Delhi.** November offers post-monsoon freshness and Diwali celebrations, while February brings mild temperatures, improving air quality, and the start of Delhi's flowering season. Both avoid the extreme heat and heavy rain that define most of the year.

Picking the right month for Delhi isn't just about preference — it can determine whether you enjoy your trip or endure it. Here's a month-by-month analysis focused on the peak visiting window, with honest notes on the downsides.

## November: Post-Monsoon Energy

**Average high**: 28 degrees C (82F) | **Average low**: 11 degrees C (52F)

November is when Delhi shakes off the monsoon and summer heat. The parks are still green from the rains, the morning air is crisp, and the city's event calendar picks up speed.

**Why November works:**

- **Diwali** (dates shift yearly, usually October-November) is India's biggest festival. Delhi goes all out — entire markets light up with decorative diyas and fairy lights. Sweet shops overflow. Fireworks are constant. The energy is infectious.
- Temperatures are warm but not punishing. You can sightsee from morning to evening without heat stress.
- Hotel prices are reasonable in early November before peak season kicks in.
- The Surajkund International Crafts Mela (if visiting in early months) and various cultural events begin.

**The catch:** From roughly November 15 onwards, Delhi's air quality deteriorates sharply. Stubble burning from farms in Punjab and Haryana, combined with cooler temperatures that trap pollutants, pushes the AQI into the 300-500 range. Some days are fine; others turn the sky grey-brown.

If pollution is a major concern for you, aim for the first two weeks of November. After that, carry an N95 mask and check daily AQI readings on the SAFAR app.

## February: The Cleaner, Cooler Choice

**Average high**: 24 degrees C (75F) | **Average low**: 8 degrees C (46F)

February is the month most Delhi residents themselves would recommend. The winter fog lifts, pollution drops significantly from the December-January peak, and temperatures sit in the most comfortable range of the year.

**Why February works:**

- Air quality improves substantially. Clear blue skies return, and you can actually see the full skyline from India Gate.
- Mild days mean you can walk for hours — perfect for exploring Old Delhi's lanes, Lodhi Gardens, and heritage walks without overheating.
- Mughal monuments look their best in February light: warm, clear, and low-angled.
- The city's spring flowers start blooming. The **Mughal Gardens** (now Amrit Udyan) at Rashtrapati Bhavan open to the public in February for their annual flower display — a rare chance to enter the President's estate. Timed entry tickets are available online.
- **Surajkund Mela** runs for two weeks in February, bringing folk performances and handicrafts from across India and partner countries.

**The catch:** February mornings are still cold. Expect 6-10 degrees C at sunrise, which matters if you're planning dawn visits to Humayun's Tomb or Qutub Minar. Layer up and carry a light jacket.

Hotel prices in February are slightly lower than December-January peak rates, making it a better value proposition.

## How Other Months Compare

### October
Warm (33 degrees C highs) but tolerable. Cleanest air of the year. Good option if you don't mind some heat and want thinner crowds. The tail end of the monsoon sometimes delivers an unexpected rain shower.

### December
Peak tourist season starts. Comfortable afternoons (18-22 degrees C) but cold mornings and heavy fog. Air quality is at its worst — expect hazy skies and limited visibility at monuments. Flights and trains face frequent fog delays, especially in early morning. Christmas and New Year bring hotel price surges.

### January
Similar to December: cold mornings (3-5 degrees C), pleasant afternoons, and ongoing pollution. **Republic Day** (January 26) is spectacular if you can get parade tickets, but security measures close large sections of central Delhi for days. More detail in our [Delhi weather guide](/delhi/what-is-the-weather-like-in-delhi/).

### March
First half is pleasant (25-28 degrees C). Second half warms up fast. **Holi** (usually mid-March) is a once-in-a-lifetime experience if you participate — strangers throw coloured powder and water at each other in the streets. Late March starts feeling like summer.

## Month-by-Month Quick Comparison

| Month | Temperature | Air Quality | Crowds | Festivals | Rating |
|-------|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| October | Warm (33°C) | Best | Low-Medium | Navratri, pre-Diwali | Good |
| November | Pleasant (28°C) | Declining | Medium | Diwali | Excellent (early), Good (late) |
| December | Cool (20°C) | Poor | High | Christmas | Good (despite pollution) |
| January | Cold (20°C) | Poor | High | Republic Day | Good |
| February | Mild (24°C) | Improving | Medium-High | Surajkund Mela | Excellent |
| March | Warming (30°C) | Moderate | Medium | Holi | Good (first half) |

## Practical Tips for November and February Visits

**Book accommodation 4-6 weeks ahead.** Both months fall within Delhi's tourism peak, and good mid-range hotels in central areas like Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, and South Delhi fill up.

**Layer your clothing.** Even in these mild months, temperatures swing 15-18 degrees between morning and afternoon. A light jacket or shawl in the morning, t-shirt by noon.

**Download the SAFAR app** for real-time air quality data. On high-pollution days, shift your plans indoors — Delhi has excellent museums, cooking classes, and indoor food markets.

**Book the Mughal Gardens in February.** Tickets for Rashtrapati Bhavan's garden open online a few weeks before the season. Slots fill fast.
