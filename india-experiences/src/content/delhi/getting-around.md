**The Delhi Metro is the single best way to get around — fast, cheap, air-conditioned, and reaches every major tourist area.** For door-to-door trips, Uber and Ola fill the gaps. Auto rickshaws handle short distances. Here's everything you need to know about transport in Delhi.

## Delhi Metro: Your Primary Transport

The Metro network has over 250 stations across 12 colour-coded lines. This is the backbone of getting around Delhi — it bypasses all traffic and costs almost nothing.

### Key Stations for Tourists

| Station | Line | What's There |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Rajiv Chowk | Yellow/Blue | Connaught Place, shopping, restaurants |
| Chandni Chowk | Yellow | Old Delhi, Red Fort, street food |
| Hauz Khas | Yellow/Magenta | South Delhi nightlife, Deer Park |
| Qutub Minar | Yellow | The 12th-century tower complex |
| Kashmere Gate | Multiple | Interchange hub |
| INA | Yellow/Pink | Dilli Haat crafts market |

### Fares and Tickets

**Single-journey tokens:** ₹10-60 depending on distance. Buy at counters or vending machines. Tap at entry, drop in slot at exit.

**Smart card:** ₹150 (₹50 deposit + ₹100 balance). Get 10% discount on every ride. Tap at entry and exit. Recharge at any station.

**Tourist card:** ₹200 for 3-day unlimited travel. Worth it if you're using the Metro 4+ times daily.

### Timings

- **Regular lines:** 5:30 AM to 11:00 PM daily
- **Airport Express:** 4:45 AM to 11:40 PM
- **Peak hours:** Trains every 2-4 minutes (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM)
- **Off-peak:** Trains every 5-8 minutes

### Security Screening

Every station has mandatory security — bag X-ray and metal detector. Takes 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on crowds. Separate lines for men and women.

### Women's Carriage

The first coach (in direction of travel) is reserved for women. Marked with pink signs. Men face ₹250 fine for using it. Less crowded and more comfortable for solo female travellers.

## Airport to City Centre

### Option 1: Airport Express Metro (Recommended)

**Cost:** ₹60 to New Delhi station
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Hours:** 4:45 AM to 11:30 PM, every 10-15 minutes

From Terminal 3, follow signs to "Metro" — it's a 5-minute walk. At New Delhi station, connect to Yellow or Blue lines.

**Best for:** Daytime arrivals, light luggage, anyone heading near a Metro station.

### Option 2: Uber or Ola

**Cost:** ₹300-500 to central Delhi
**Time:** 30-60 minutes depending on traffic

You need an Indian SIM card for OTP verification. Get one at the airport first (Airtel/Jio counters in arrivals, ₹500-700).

**Fares:**
- Connaught Place: ₹300-500
- South Delhi: ₹250-400
- Old Delhi: ₹350-550

**Best for:** Groups, heavy luggage, late-night arrivals, door-to-door convenience.

### Option 3: Prepaid Taxi

**Cost:** ₹400-600 (25% surcharge 11 PM - 5 AM)
**Where:** Official counter inside arrivals hall

Pay at the counter, get a receipt, hand it to the driver at your destination. No haggling required.

**Best for:** Anyone without an Indian SIM card, first-time visitors wanting simplicity.

### What to Avoid

Don't take unmetered taxis from drivers who approach you. Walk past anyone offering taxi services inside the terminal. Use only the official prepaid counter or ride-hailing apps.

## Uber and Ola

Both apps work throughout Delhi. Download before you arrive, but you'll need an Indian SIM to book rides (OTP verification).

### Getting Started

1. Buy a SIM at the airport (Airtel or Jio, ₹500-700)
2. Wait for activation (15-60 minutes)
3. Open Uber/Ola, verify your number
4. Book rides with cash or card payment

### Typical Fares

| Route | Cost |
|-------|------|
| CP to Hauz Khas | ₹200-300 |
| CP to Old Delhi | ₹150-250 |
| Airport to CP | ₹300-500 |
| Cross-city (15-20 km) | ₹200-400 |

### Uber Auto

Books you an auto rickshaw through the app at a fixed fare. No negotiating. Great for short trips where a car feels excessive.

### Tips

- **Surge pricing** hits during rush hours and rain. Check fare before booking.
- **Cash payment** works, but card/wallet is smoother.
- **Verify the car** — match plate number and driver photo before getting in.

## Auto Rickshaws

The green-and-yellow three-wheelers are everywhere. Good for 1-5 km trips where Metro doesn't make sense.

### The Rules

- **Always agree on price before getting in.** Most drivers won't use meters with tourists.
- **Fair price:** ₹30 for first 1.5 km, then ₹10-15 per km.
- **Don't take autos parked at tourist sites.** They charge 3-5x. Walk away and hail a moving one.
- **Carry small notes.** Drivers rarely break ₹500.

### When to Use

- Last-mile from Metro station to destination
- Short hops within a neighbourhood
- When you're not in a rush and want the experience

### When to Skip

- Rush hour on main roads (you'll be stuck in traffic)
- During monsoon rains (no cover)
- With heavy luggage

## Delhi to Agra

The Taj Mahal is a popular day trip from Delhi. Here are your options:

### By Train (Recommended)

| Train | Duration | Fare | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Gatimaan Express | 1 hr 40 min | ₹750-1500 | Fastest, leaves 8:10 AM |
| Shatabdi Express | 2 hours | ₹500-1000 | Multiple departures |
| Regular trains | 2.5-3 hours | ₹100-300 | Frequent, less comfortable |

Book on IRCTC website or app. Gatimaan and Shatabdi require advance booking.

### By Car

**Distance:** 230 km via Yamuna Expressway
**Time:** 4-5 hours each way
**Cost:** ₹4,000-6,000 for a return trip with driver

Hiring a car gives you flexibility — stop at Sikandra (Akbar's Tomb) or Fatehpur Sikri on the way back.

### Day Tours

Organised tours from Delhi run ₹3,000-8,000 per person including transport, guide, and sometimes entry fees. Viator and GetYourGuide have reliable options.

## What NOT to Use

**City buses:** Overcrowded, confusing routes, no English signage. Not worth the hassle.

**Street taxis:** The black-and-yellow Ambassador cabs are nearly extinct. Those remaining refuse meters. Use Uber/Ola instead.

**Cycle rickshaws for distance:** Fine for a short ride through Old Delhi's lanes. Don't use for anything over 1-2 km.

## Daily Transport Costs

| Travel Style | Daily Spend |
|--------------|-------------|
| Budget (Metro only) | ₹100-200 |
| Mid-range (Metro + 2 Ubers) | ₹300-500 |
| Comfortable (Mostly Uber) | ₹600-1,000 |

The Metro makes Delhi one of the cheapest major cities to get around. A 3-day tourist card costs ₹200 — that's unlimited rides for less than one Uber trip.
