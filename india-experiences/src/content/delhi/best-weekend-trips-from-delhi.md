  - question: "What are the best weekend trips from Delhi?"
    answer: "The top weekend getaways from Delhi are Agra (3-4 hours, Taj Mahal), Jaipur (5 hours, forts and palaces), Rishikesh (6 hours, yoga and rafting), Neemrana Fort (2 hours, heritage hotel and zip-lining), Mathura-Vrindavan (3 hours, Krishna temples), Bharatpur (5 hours, bird sanctuary), and Jim Corbett National Park (6 hours, tiger safari)."
  - question: "What is the closest weekend getaway from Delhi?"
    answer: "Neemrana Fort Palace is the closest worthwhile weekend escape — just 120 km and about 2 hours by car on NH48 toward Jaipur. It's a restored 15th-century fort converted into a heritage hotel with zip-lining, a pool, and Rajasthani dining. You can also visit as a day trip without staying overnight."
  - question: "Which is better for a weekend from Delhi: Rishikesh or Jaipur?"
    answer: "They're completely different experiences. Choose Rishikesh for outdoor activities — river rafting, trekking, yoga retreats, and mountain scenery. Choose Jaipur for history, architecture, shopping, and Rajasthani food. Rishikesh is better in September-November and March-May. Jaipur is best October-March. Both are about 5-6 hours from Delhi."

**Agra for the Taj Mahal, Jaipur for forts and bazaars, Rishikesh for river rafting and yoga, Neemrana for a heritage hotel escape, and Jim Corbett for tiger safaris — Delhi sits at the centre of some of India's best weekend destinations.** All of these are reachable in 2-6 hours by road or train.

## 1. Agra — The Taj Mahal and Mughal Monuments

**Distance**: 230 km / 3-4 hours by car, 1 hour 40 minutes by Gatimaan Express
**Best for**: First-time India visitors, history and architecture
**Stay**: 1 night (or do it as a [day trip](/delhi/can-you-do-a-day-trip-from-delhi-to-agra/))

Agra works as both a day trip and an overnight. With a night there, you can see the Taj Mahal at sunrise (the best light and fewest crowds), visit Agra Fort, and drive out to **Fatehpur Sikri** — Emperor Akbar's abandoned sandstone city, 40 km west.

**Budget**: Gatimaan Express tickets ₹750-1,500 ($9-18) each way. Taj Mahal entry ₹1,100 ($13). Hotels from ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60) per night.

For full transport details, see our guide on [how to get from Delhi to Agra](/delhi/how-to-get-from-delhi-to-agra/).

## 2. Jaipur — Forts, Palaces, and Pink City Bazaars

**Distance**: 270 km / 5-6 hours by car, 4.5 hours by Shatabdi Express
**Best for**: Architecture, shopping, Rajasthani food
**Stay**: 2 nights ideal, 1 night minimum

Jaipur is too big for a day trip but perfect for a weekend. **Amber Fort** is the centrepiece — a massive hilltop complex with the famous Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors). Add **City Palace**, **Hawa Mahal**, **Jantar Mantar** (the 18th-century astronomical observatory), and the chaotic, colourful bazaars of the old walled city.

Stay in a **haveli** (traditional mansion) in the old city. Heritage hotels start at ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) per night and give you the full Rajasthan experience — painted courtyards, rooftop dinners, and walking access to the markets.

**Budget**: Shatabdi tickets ₹800-1,600 ($9.60-19) each way. Heritage hotel ₹3,000-10,000 ($36-120) per night. Amber Fort entry ₹550 ($6.50).

## 3. Rishikesh — River Rafting, Yoga, and Mountains

**Distance**: 240 km / 5-6 hours by car
**Best for**: Adventure, wellness, outdoor activities
**Stay**: 2 nights

Rishikesh sits where the Ganges leaves the Himalayas and enters the plains. The town is divided into three areas: **Rishikesh town** (practical, not interesting), **Ram Jhula/Laxman Jhula** (backpacker area, ashrams, cafes), and the **rafting camps** upstream near Shivpuri.

The top activities: white-water rafting on the Ganges (Grade III-IV rapids, ₹1,500-2,500/$18-30 per person), bungee jumping at Jumpin Heights (₹3,500/$42), cliff jumping, and yoga classes at one of dozens of ashrams. The **Beatles Ashram** (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's former compound) is now an open-air gallery with graffiti art — entry ₹600 ($7).

**Best season**: September-November and March-May. Monsoon (July-August) closes the rafting camps. Winter (December-February) is cold but clear.

**Budget**: Car hire ₹4,000-6,000 ($48-72) one way. Camp stays from ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60) per night including meals. Rafting ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30).

## 4. Neemrana Fort Palace — Heritage Hotel Escape

**Distance**: 120 km / 2 hours by car on NH48
**Best for**: Couples, relaxation, quick escape
**Stay**: 1 night (or [visit as a day trip](/delhi/is-neemrana-fort-worth-visiting-from-delhi/))

[Neemrana](/delhi/is-neemrana-fort-worth-visiting-from-delhi/) is the easiest weekend trip from Delhi. This 15th-century fort has been restored into a heritage hotel with tiered terraces, a pool, zip-lining across the fort walls, and a restaurant serving Rajasthani thalis. The rooms have original stone walls and period furniture.

Even if you don't stay overnight, you can visit for lunch, a swim, and zip-lining as a day visitor (pool use ₹1,500/$18 per person, zip-lining ₹2,000-3,500/$24-42).

**Budget**: Rooms from ₹6,000-15,000 ($72-180) per night. Lunch ₹1,000-2,000 ($12-24) per person. Car hire ₹2,500-3,500 ($30-42) return.

## 5. Mathura and Vrindavan — Krishna's Birthplace

**Distance**: 180 km / 3-3.5 hours by car
**Best for**: Temple culture, religious festivals, photography
**Stay**: 1 night or [day trip](/delhi/day-trip-to-mathura-and-vrindavan-from-delhi/)

Mathura is where Lord Krishna was born, and Vrindavan (15 km north) is where he grew up — together they form one of Hinduism's holiest pilgrimage circuits. The temples range from ancient stone structures to the modern, enormous **Prem Mandir** (a white marble temple that lights up at night).

The best time to visit is during **Holi** in March, when Mathura and Vrindavan host the most intense Holi celebrations in India — weeks of colour-throwing, processions, and music.

**Budget**: Car hire ₹3,000-4,000 ($36-48) return. Temple entry free. Hotels from ₹1,500-4,000 ($18-48) per night.

## 6. Bharatpur (Keoladeo National Park) — Birdwatching

**Distance**: 220 km / 4.5-5 hours by car
**Best for**: Birdwatching, nature, quiet
**Stay**: 1-2 nights

Keoladeo National Park (formerly Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the best birdwatching spots in Asia. Over 350 species have been recorded here, including migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia during winter (October-February).

The park is explored by bicycle or cycle-rickshaw on flat paths through wetlands and dry scrubland. Hire a park-approved guide (₹400-600/$4.80-7 for a 3-hour tour) who'll spot birds you'd walk right past.

**Best season**: October-February for migratory birds. Avoid April-June (extreme heat, fewer birds).

**Budget**: Park entry ₹400 ($4.80) for foreigners. Cycle-rickshaw ₹300-500 ($3.60-6) for 3-4 hours. Hotels from ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60) per night. Combine with Agra (Bharatpur is 55 km from Agra).

## 7. Jim Corbett National Park — Tiger Safari

**Distance**: 260 km / 5-6 hours by car
**Best for**: Wildlife, jungle lodges, families
**Stay**: 2 nights minimum

India's oldest national park and one of the best places to spot Bengal tigers. The park has multiple zones — **Dhikala** (deepest in the forest, requires an overnight stay inside the park), **Bijrani**, **Jhirna**, and **Durga Devi**. Jeep safaris run twice daily (morning and afternoon).

**Safari booking**: Book through the official Uttarakhand Forest Department website at least 30-45 days in advance. Dhikala zone books out months ahead. Entry fees, jeep hire, and guide cost ₹5,000-8,000 ($60-96) per safari.

**Best season**: November-June. The park partially closes during monsoon (July-September). March-June offers the best tiger sighting chances as animals gather near water sources.

**Budget**: Jungle lodge ₹5,000-15,000 ($60-180) per night including meals. Two safaris ₹10,000-16,000 ($120-192). Car hire from Delhi ₹5,000-7,000 ($60-84) one way.
