**Hauz Khas pairs 700-year-old ruins overlooking a lake with Delhi's most concentrated nightlife scene, all packed into a single narrow lane in South Delhi.** Come in the afternoon for the ruins, Deer Park, and boutique shopping, then stay for dinner and drinks as the village transforms after dark.

The name "Hauz Khas" means "Royal Tank" — a reference to the massive reservoir built by Sultan Alauddin Khalji in 1296 to supply water to his new city, Siri. The ruins you see today are mainly from the 14th century under Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who added a madrasa (Islamic seminary), mosque, and his own tomb overlooking the water.

## Hauz Khas Complex: The Ruins

The ruins are free to enter and open from sunrise to sunset. Walk through the arched corridors of the old madrasa, now roofless and atmospheric, with the lake visible through the stone frames. Firoz Shah Tughlaq's domed tomb sits at the northern end — smaller than the grand Mughal tombs but peaceful and uncrowded.

The lake itself is now a managed reservoir surrounded by trees. In winter, migratory birds settle here — spot egrets, cormorants, and kingfishers from the upper walkways.

**Best time to visit the ruins:** Late afternoon, around 4-5 PM. The light is golden on the stone, the crowds are thin, and you can walk directly from the ruins into the village for an early dinner.

**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes for the ruins and tomb.

## Deer Park

Adjacent to the Hauz Khas Complex, Deer Park is a green space with — yes — actual deer roaming behind low fences. It's also home to peacocks, rabbits, and a variety of birds. The park has walking paths, rose gardens, and a district park section with jogging tracks.

Locals use it for morning walks and evening jogs. For tourists, it's a welcome stretch of open green space after the density of Delhi's streets. Free entry, open dawn to dusk.

**Nearby:** The Rose Garden within the park complex is at its best from November to February. The duck pond attracts photographers year-round.

## Hauz Khas Village: Shopping and Art

The narrow lane leading to the ruins has evolved into a strip of independent boutiques, art galleries, and design stores. This isn't a market in the Old Delhi sense — prices are higher, the aesthetic is contemporary, and the crowd skews young and creative.

**What to browse:**

- **Art galleries** — several small spaces showcasing contemporary Indian artists. Exhibitions rotate monthly.
- **Boutique fashion** — independent labels selling designer Indian and fusion wear. Expect ₹3,000-15,000 per piece.
- **Vintage and antique shops** — furniture, textiles, and curiosities. Good for one-of-a-kind finds.
- **Home decor** — handmade ceramics, block-printed textiles, brass items.

The village is small enough to walk end to end in 15 minutes. Most shops open by 11 AM and close by 8 PM.

## Nightlife and Restaurants

Hauz Khas Village has the highest density of bars per metre in Delhi. They're stacked on top of each other in converted houses along the narrow lane, each with rooftop terraces overlooking the ruins and lake.

**Popular spots:**

- **Social** — co-working space by day, bar by night. Good cocktails, rooftop seating, casual crowd.
- **Imperfecto** — eclectic decor, strong cocktail menu, live music some nights
- **Maquina** — popular weekend spot, DJs, and a younger crowd
- **Raasta** — reggae and Caribbean-themed, good for groups

Most bars serve food too — expect ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36) per person for drinks and dinner. Cocktails run ₹400-700, pints of beer ₹300-500.

**Peak hours:** Thursday through Saturday after 8 PM. Book tables at popular spots — walk-ins are hit or miss on weekends.

## How To Get There

**Metro:** Hauz Khas station serves both the Yellow Line and Magenta Line. Exit Gate 1 and walk south along Aurobindo Marg for about 10 minutes. Alternatively, take an auto or Uber from the station — it's a short ₹30-50 ride.

**By Uber/Ola:** Drop at "Hauz Khas Village" — drivers know it. The entrance is a narrow lane off Aurobindo Marg. Parking is extremely limited, so don't drive.

**From Connaught Place:** Rajiv Chowk to Hauz Khas by Metro takes about 15 minutes on the Yellow Line.

## Practical Tips

**Weekday vs weekend:** Weekday afternoons are the best time if you want to see the ruins and shop without crowds. The village is completely different on a Saturday night — packed, loud, and energetic.

**Combine with South Delhi:** Hauz Khas is central to Delhi's southern sightseeing belt. From here, Qutub Minar is 15 minutes by Uber, Lodhi Gardens is 20 minutes, and Khan Market is 25 minutes. See our full [South Delhi guide](/delhi/things-to-do-in-south-delhi/) for planning a combined day.

**The lane is steep and uneven** in places. Wear shoes you can walk in comfortably, especially if you're heading to the ruins.
