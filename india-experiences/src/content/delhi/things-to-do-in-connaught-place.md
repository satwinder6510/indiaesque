  - question: "What is there to see in Connaught Place?"
    answer: "Agrasen ki Baoli (a 14th-century stepwell tucked between office buildings), Jantar Mantar (18th-century astronomical instruments), the colonial-era architecture of the inner circle itself, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib (a stunning Sikh temple with free food served to all visitors), and the Central Park with its large Indian flag. CP is also Delhi's best area for restaurants, bars, and shopping."
  - question: "How do I get to Connaught Place?"
    answer: "Take the Metro to Rajiv Chowk station (Yellow and Blue Line intersection) — it exits directly into Connaught Place. This is the most central Metro station in Delhi. Uber and Ola can drop you at the outer circle, but traffic around CP is heavy during business hours. The inner circle is fully pedestrianised and best explored on foot."
  - question: "Is Connaught Place good for shopping?"
    answer: "Yes, but it's not a bargaining market. CP has a mix of international brands (Zara, H&M), Indian brands (FabIndia, Good Earth), bookshops (The Bookshop on N Block), and the underground Palika Bazaar for cheap electronics and knockoff goods. For traditional crafts at fixed prices, visit the Central Cottage Industries Emporium on Janpath, a 10-minute walk south of CP."

**Connaught Place — locals just call it CP — is Delhi's colonial-era commercial heart, a circular complex of white colonnaded buildings that functions as the city's main meeting point, restaurant district, and nightlife hub.** The Rajiv Chowk Metro station sits directly underneath, making CP the most connected neighbourhood in Delhi.

CP isn't really about sightseeing in the traditional sense. You come here to eat, drink, shop, and use it as a base for exploring. That said, two genuinely interesting historical sites sit within walking distance.

## What To See

### Agrasen ki Baoli

A 14th-century stepwell hidden between modern office buildings on Hailey Road, a 10-minute walk from CP's outer circle. The 60-metre long, 15-metre wide step structure descends three levels into the earth, with 108 steps leading down to where the water level once was. It's atmospheric, photogenic, and usually uncrowded.

**Entry:** Free. Open sunrise to sunset. No guards or tickets — you just walk in.

For the full history and visiting tips, read our [Agrasen ki Baoli guide](/delhi/what-is-agrasen-ki-baoli/).

### Jantar Mantar

One of five astronomical observation sites built by Maharaja Jai Singh II in 1724. The 13 instruments — massive geometric structures in red stone and plaster — were used to track celestial bodies and tell time with remarkable accuracy. It looks surreal, like abstract architecture dropped into central Delhi.

**Entry:** ₹200 ($2.40) for foreigners, ₹25 for Indians. Open sunrise to sunset. Budget 30-45 minutes.

**Location:** On Sansad Marg, a 5-minute walk from CP's inner circle.

### Gurudwara Bangla Sahib

A massive Sikh temple with a gold dome and reflecting pool (sarovar), visible from many points around CP. Entry is free and open to all — remove your shoes, cover your head (scarves provided at the entrance), and walk through. The langar (communal kitchen) serves free meals to anyone, regardless of religion, 24 hours a day. Joining the langar line is one of Delhi's most grounding experiences.

**Location:** On Baba Kharak Singh Marg, just north of CP's outer circle.

### The Architecture Itself

Connaught Place was designed by British architects Robert Tor Russell and W. H. Nicholls in the 1930s. The concentric circles — inner, middle, and outer — with their white colonnades were modelled on the Royal Crescent in Bath, England. The inner circle is now pedestrianised with landscaped sections. Walk the full circle (about 1.5 km) to see the mix of Art Deco facades and repurposed colonial shops.

## Where To Eat

CP has the highest concentration of sit-down restaurants in Delhi. Some highlights:

- **Saravana Bhavan** (P Block) — South Indian chain, reliable dosas and thalis, ₹200-400 per person
- **Wenger's** (A Block) — colonial-era bakery since 1926, pastries and patties
- **Kwality** (Regal Building) — old-school North Indian, butter chicken since the 1930s
- **Nizam's** (H Block) — the original kathi roll from Kolkata, quick and cheap
- **The Imperial** (on Janpath, 10-minute walk) — high tea in a heritage hotel, ₹2,500+ per person

## Nightlife

CP is Delhi's most active nightlife district. The concentration of bars and clubs between N Block and M Block on the outer circle stays busy until midnight on weekends.

- **Unplugged Courtyard** — rooftop bar, live music on weekends
- **Lord of the Drinks** — three floors of bar space, cocktails
- **1911** at The Imperial — elegant bar in a heritage hotel setting
- **The Piano Man Jazz Club** — live jazz performances, cocktails

Rajiv Chowk Metro closes around 11 PM, so plan Uber or Ola for later nights. Our full [Delhi nightlife guide](/delhi/best-nightlife-in-delhi/) covers the latest spots.

## Shopping

**Inner circle:** International and Indian brands at standard retail prices. FabIndia for Indian textiles and home goods. Good Earth for upscale Indian design. The Bookshop on N Block for a curated selection of India-related titles.

**Janpath Market** (10-minute walk south): An outdoor market selling handicrafts, jewellery, leather goods, and clothing. Bargaining is expected — start at 40% of the asking price. Best for souvenirs.

**Central Cottage Industries Emporium** (Janpath): A government-run store with fixed prices on handicrafts, textiles, carpets, and jewellery from across India. No bargaining needed. Good for quality assurance, though prices are higher than wholesale markets.

**Palika Bazaar** (underground, Central Park): A sunken market selling electronics, watches, sunglasses, and clothing at cheap prices. Quality varies wildly. Bargain hard and don't expect authenticity on branded goods.

## Getting Around CP

The inner and middle circles are fully walkable — a complete loop of the inner circle takes about 20 minutes. Rajiv Chowk Metro station has multiple exits connecting to different blocks of CP.

For the outer circle and surrounding roads (Barakhamba Road, Kasturba Gandhi Marg, Janpath), walking is still the best option during business hours — traffic is gridlocked and an Uber won't move faster than you.

## Practical Tips

**When to go:** Restaurants are open 11 AM to 11 PM. Bars stay open until midnight or later on weekends. Shopping is best between 11 AM and 7 PM. Avoid the outer circle roads during rush hour (5-8 PM) — the traffic is suffocating.

**Street hawkers around the outer circle** sell cheap sunglasses, phone cases, and trinkets. Quality is low. They'll approach you persistently — a firm "no" works.

**WiFi:** Most restaurants and cafes in CP have free WiFi. Starbucks on the inner circle is a reliable spot for working or charging your phone.
