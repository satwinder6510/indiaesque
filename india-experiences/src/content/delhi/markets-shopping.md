Delhi's markets are as old as its empires. Some of these bazaars were laid out in the 17th century by Mughal architects; others sprang up around railway stations in the British era; a few are government-designed experiments from the 1970s. Each has its own personality, price range, and specialty — and each requires a slightly different shopping strategy.

This guide covers Delhi's seven most important markets for visitors, organised by what they sell and what you'll pay. For trip planning context, see the [Delhi city guide](/delhi/).

## Chandni Chowk

**Metro:** Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line) | **Best for:** Textiles, wedding shopping, spices, electronics | **Bargaining:** Yes, aggressively | **Best time:** Tuesday-Saturday, 11:00am-7:00pm (closed Sunday)

Chandni Chowk is not one market — it's an entire ecosystem of specialised bazaars packed into the lanes of Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's daughter Jahanara designed the main street in 1650, and it hasn't stopped trading since. The current version is chaotic, loud, and incredibly dense. You'll share lane space with cycle rickshaws, handcarts, motorcycles, and about 50,000 other shoppers.

**What to buy here:**

- **Textiles and fabrics:** The lanes behind Chandni Chowk metro station are packed with fabric shops selling silk, cotton, chiffon, and embroidered materials by the metre. Prices start at ₹200 ($2.50) per metre for basic cotton and go to ₹5,000+ ($60+) for Banarasi silk. If you're buying fabric for Indian clothing (kurtas, sarees, lehengas), this is where Delhi's tailors source their material.
- **Wedding shopping:** Kinari Bazaar specialises in wedding trimmings — sequined borders, gold thread, decorative dupattas, and bridal accessories. Even if you're not getting married, the visual overload of glitter and colour is worth a walk-through.
- **Spices:** Khari Baoli, one block north of the main Chandni Chowk road, is Asia's largest wholesale spice market. The ground floor of the old haveli buildings is stacked with sacks of turmeric, chilli, cumin, cardamom, and dried fruits. Even if you don't buy, the smell alone is worth the detour. Read our [guide to buying spices in Delhi](/delhi/where-to-buy-spices-in-delhi/) for tips on what to pick and how much to pay.
- **Electronics:** Gaffar Market (technically in Karol Bagh, but part of the greater Chandni Chowk shopping universe) sells mobile phones, cameras, and accessories at prices well below MRP.

**Bargaining tips for Chandni Chowk:** Start at 40% of the asking price. Shopkeepers expect negotiation and price items 2-3x above what they'll accept. Walk away if the price doesn't drop — there are dozens of identical shops in every lane. Don't bargain for items under ₹100; it's not worth the energy.

**Fair warning:** Chandni Chowk is overwhelming for first-time visitors. The lanes are narrow, signage is in Hindi, and GPS gets confused between floors of stacked buildings. If you want a guided introduction, pair your shopping trip with an [Old Delhi food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) — most food tour guides know the market layout well.

## Khan Market

**Metro:** Khan Market (Violet Line) | **Best for:** Books, boutique clothing, international brands, cafes | **Bargaining:** No | **Best time:** Monday-Saturday, 10:30am-8:00pm (some shops closed Sunday)

Khan Market is Delhi's most expensive retail address and consistently ranks among Asia's priciest shopping streets. The clientele is diplomats, expats, and South Delhi professionals. The prices reflect this — a cotton kurta here costs ₹3,000-8,000 ($36-96), roughly 3-5x what you'd pay in Chandni Chowk.

What Khan Market does well is curation. Bahrisons Booksellers (since 1953) and Full Circle Bookstore stock excellent collections of Indian literature, history, and photography books. Fab India and Good Earth sell high-quality Indian textiles and homewares with fixed prices and air-conditioned comfort. Anand Stationers has an improbably good collection of notebooks, pens, and paper.

The food options are strong too — Big Chill for pasta and desserts, Perch Wine & Coffee Bar on the rooftop, and Wenger's for bakery items. Khan Market is a good place to take a break from the sensory load of Old Delhi.

Is the premium worth it? For books and specific boutique brands, yes. For generic clothing and souvenirs, you'll pay 3-5x the street market price. Read our full breakdown: [Is Khan Market expensive?](/delhi/is-khan-market-expensive/)

## Sarojini Nagar

**Metro:** INA (Yellow Line), then auto-rickshaw or walk 10 minutes | **Best for:** Cheap fashion, export surplus clothing | **Bargaining:** Yes | **Best time:** Tuesday-Saturday, 10:00am-8:00pm (busiest on weekends)

Sarojini Nagar is where Delhi goes for cheap clothes. The market sells export-surplus and rejected stock from international brands — you'll find H&M, Zara, Gap, and Marks & Spencer labels at ₹100-500 ($1-6) per piece. The quality varies. Some items are genuinely overstock with minor defects (a missed stitch, a slightly off colour); others are knockoffs.

The key to Sarojini is patience and a sharp eye. Dig through the piles on the tables — the best pieces are always buried. T-shirts go for ₹100-200, jeans for ₹300-500, dresses for ₹200-400, and jackets for ₹500-1,000. These are not negotiable starting prices; this is the price after bargaining.

The market is extremely crowded on weekends and completely closed on Mondays. If you can go on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning, you'll have more space to browse and better negotiating leverage.

## Dilli Haat

**Metro:** INA (Yellow Line) — it's right at the station exit | **Best for:** Handicrafts, state-specific crafts, souvenirs, regional food | **Bargaining:** Limited | **Best time:** Any day, 10:30am-10:00pm

[Dilli Haat](/delhi/what-is-dilli-haat/) is a government-run open-air craft market designed to give artisans from across India a permanent selling space in Delhi. Entry is ₹30 ($0.35) for Indians, ₹100 ($1.25) for foreigners. The stalls rotate every two weeks, so the selection changes depending on when you visit.

You'll find handloom textiles from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, Pashmina shawls from Kashmir, brass and bell-metal work from Madhya Pradesh, blue pottery from Rajasthan, and Kalamkari prints from Telangana. Prices are higher than buying directly in those states but lower than most tourist shops in Delhi.

Bargaining is possible but the margins are slimmer — artisans here are selling closer to cost than Chandni Chowk shopkeepers. Aim for 10-20% off the stated price on larger purchases (₹500+). Smaller items under ₹200 are usually priced fairly.

The food stalls at the back of Dilli Haat are reason enough to visit. Each stall represents a different Indian state's cuisine — Nagaland pork with bamboo shoot, Rajasthani dal baati churma, Gujarati thali, Kerala fish curry. Prices are ₹100-250 per plate.

## Janpath

**Metro:** Rajiv Chowk (Yellow/Blue Line), then 5-minute walk south | **Best for:** Tourist souvenirs, jewellery, cheap clothing | **Bargaining:** Yes, hard | **Best time:** Monday-Saturday, 10:00am-7:30pm

Janpath Market is the tourist souvenir strip. It runs along a stretch of pavement opposite the Imperial Hotel on Janpath road. The stalls sell embroidered bags, silver jewellery, printed scarves, miniature paintings, incense, and carved wooden boxes — the standard Indian souvenir kit.

Quality ranges from decent artisan work to mass-produced junk. The better stalls are toward the southern end. Opening prices are wildly inflated — 3-5x what you should pay. Bargain hard and be prepared to walk away. A "silver" ring offered at ₹800 should sell for ₹200-300. An embroidered bag marked at ₹1,500 is worth ₹400-600.

Janpath's main advantage is location — it's a 5-minute walk from Connaught Place and easy to fold into a day of sightseeing. It's also the only market in this guide where you can buy souvenirs for 20 people in under an hour.

## Lajpat Nagar Central Market

**Metro:** Lajpat Nagar (Violet Line) | **Best for:** Everyday clothing, home goods, mehndi (henna) | **Bargaining:** Yes | **Best time:** Tuesday-Sunday, 10:30am-8:30pm (closed Monday)

Lajpat Nagar is a middle-class shopping market that's less touristy than Sarojini but similarly chaotic. The main draw for visitors is the mehndi (henna) lane — a row of stalls where artists will cover your hands and forearms with intricate henna designs for ₹100-500 depending on complexity. This is where Delhi brides come for their wedding mehndi.

The market also sells Indian clothing (kurtas, churidars, salwar kameez) at moderate prices — better quality than Sarojini, cheaper than Khan Market. If you want to buy Indian clothes to wear during your trip, this is a good middle ground.

## Khari Baoli Spice Market

**Metro:** Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line), then walk 10 minutes west | **Best for:** Spices, dried fruits, herbs, tea | **Bargaining:** Yes | **Best time:** Morning (9:00am-1:00pm, before it gets too hot and pungent)

Khari Baoli deserves its own section even though it's technically part of the Chandni Chowk area. This is Asia's largest wholesale spice market, operating since the 17th century from the ground floors of old havelis along a single narrow road.

What to buy: whole spices travel best and stay fresh longest. Kashmiri red chilli (₹300-500/kg), green cardamom (₹2,000-3,000/kg), black pepper (₹600-800/kg), saffron (₹200,000-350,000/kg — yes, per kilo; buy by the gram at ₹20-35 per gram). Dried mango powder (amchur), black salt, and chat masala make good souvenirs. Buy whole spices and grind at home for the strongest flavour.

**Tip:** Bring a resealable bag. The market sells by weight, and the plastic bags they give you won't survive a suitcase journey. Ziplock bags or small tins work better.

## General Bargaining Tips

Bargaining is expected in all street markets in Delhi — Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, Janpath, and Lajpat Nagar. It's not expected at Khan Market, malls, or stores with printed MRP (Maximum Retail Price) tags.

**How to bargain:**

1. **Ask the price.** The shopkeeper gives the opening number, which is typically 2-3x the expected selling price.
2. **Counter at 40-50%.** Say your number matter-of-factly. Don't apologise or justify.
3. **Expect them to meet you at 60-70%.** This is the target zone for most items.
4. **Walk away if needed.** The most effective bargaining tool in any Delhi market is turning and walking toward the next shop. If their price is reasonable, they'll call you back.
5. **Be respectful.** Bargaining is a business negotiation, not a confrontation. Smile, be firm, keep it light.

**Don't bargain** on items under ₹50, on food, or with visibly struggling street vendors. The ₹10 difference isn't worth the awkwardness.
