**Delhi's craft beer scene centres on Bira 91 Taproom in Cyber Hub, Ek Bar in Defence Colony, Cocktails and Dreams in Gurgaon, and several bars in Hauz Khas Village — expect to pay ₹300-600 ($3.60-7) per pint.** The scene has grown fast since 2015, and you now have access to IPAs, wheat beers, stouts, and seasonal brews that weren't available a few years ago.

## Best Craft Beer Spots

### Bira 91 Taproom — Cyber Hub, Gurgaon

India's most recognisable craft beer brand has its flagship taproom in Cyber Hub (technically Gurgaon, but just across the Delhi border on the Yellow Line metro). They pour 8-10 beers on tap that rotate seasonally, including variants you won't find in bottles — barrel-aged stouts, limited IPAs, and experimental sours.

**Cost:** ₹350-500 ($4-6) per pint. **Happy hour:** 12-7 PM, reduced prices on select taps. **Metro:** HUDA City Centre (Yellow Line), then a short cab to Cyber Hub. **Vibe:** Modern, open-air seating, after-work crowd on weekdays.

### Ek Bar — Defence Colony

More cocktail bar than beer bar, but Ek Bar stocks a curated selection of Indian craft beers alongside their inventive cocktail menu. The beer list changes regularly and typically includes options from Simba, White Rhino, and Bira 91.

**Cost:** ₹400-550 ($5-6.50) per pint; cocktails ₹500-800. **Best for:** A drink before or after dinner at one of Defence Colony market's many [restaurants](/delhi/best-restaurants-in-delhi/). **Metro:** Lajpat Nagar (Violet Line), then auto.

### Raasta — Hauz Khas Village

A reggae-themed bar spread across multiple floors in Hauz Khas Village. The rooftop has views over the medieval reservoir and deer park. Beer selection includes mainstream craft options (Bira 91, White Owl) alongside imports.

**Cost:** ₹300-500 ($3.60-6) per pint. **Best for:** Afternoon drinks on the rooftop. Goes from chill to loud after 10 PM. **Metro:** Green Park (Yellow Line), then auto to Hauz Khas Village.

### Social — Multiple Locations

Social operates in Hauz Khas, Connaught Place, Nehru Place, and several other spots. Part co-working space, part bar, they serve a solid range of craft beers and have some of the more reasonable prices in the city. The Hauz Khas branch in [Hauz Khas Village](/delhi/things-to-do-in-hauz-khas/) has the best atmosphere.

**Cost:** ₹250-400 ($3-5) per pint. **Happy hour:** Most locations run deals from 12-7 PM.

### The Beer Cafe — Multiple Locations

India's first dedicated beer chain, with branches in Connaught Place (inner circle), Nehru Place, and Cyber Hub. They stock 50+ beer varieties, including several Indian craft options. The CP branch is convenient for tourists.

**Cost:** ₹300-500 ($3.60-6) per pint. **Best for:** When you want options — their menu has more variety than any single bar in Delhi. **Metro:** Rajiv Chowk (Yellow/Blue Line) for CP branch.

### Cocktails and Dreams Speakeasy — Sector 29, Gurgaon

Despite the name, they stock an excellent craft beer selection. The bar is designed as a 1920s speakeasy — dim lighting, leather seating, and a hidden entrance (look for the barber shop door). The beer menu focuses on Indian craft with rotating taps.

**Cost:** ₹400-600 ($5-7) per pint. **Best for:** A proper night out. Dress code is smart casual.

## Indian Craft Beer Brands to Try

If you're new to Indian craft beer, these are the brands worth seeking out:

- **Bira 91** — the most widely available. The White (wheat beer) and Blonde (lager) are solid everyday drinks. Their IPA is the best mass-market IPA in India.
- **White Rhino** — brewed in the hills north of Delhi. Their Belgian Wit and Indian Pale Ale are clean and well-made.
- **Simba** — Stout and Wit variants are the standouts. Slightly cheaper than Bira.
- **Kati Patang** — wheat beers and lagers from Uttarakhand. Light, easy drinking.
- **Goa Brewing Co.** — Available at some Delhi bars. Their Eight Finger Eddie IPA is worth trying.

## Where to Buy Craft Beer (Takeaway)

If you prefer drinking at your hotel or guesthouse:

**Liquor shops (thekas)** across Delhi stock bottled craft beer. Chains like **Living Liquidz** and **The Liquor Store** have the widest selection, including Bira 91, White Rhino, and Simba. A 330ml bottle costs ₹200-350 ($2.40-4). Shops in South Delhi and central Delhi tend to stock more craft options than those in outer areas.
