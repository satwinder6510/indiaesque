**The National Science Centre, Delhi Zoo, Rail Museum, and Akshardham Temple are the strongest picks for families — all cost under ₹200 per person and keep kids engaged for 2-3 hours each.** Delhi isn't an obvious family destination, but it has more child-friendly spots than most visitors expect.

The trick is planning around weather and energy. Mornings are for outdoor activities, afternoons for indoor ones (especially in summer), and evenings for the big spectacle — Akshardham's fountain show. Here's what works, broken down by age and interest.

## Outdoor Activities

### Delhi Zoo (National Zoological Park)

Near Pragati Maidan in central Delhi, the zoo covers 176 acres with a good mix of Indian and African wildlife. The white tiger enclosure is the big draw, along with hippos, elephants, and a reptile house.

**Entry:** ₹40 ($0.50) for Indians, ₹200 ($2.40) for foreigners. Children under 5 free.
**Hours:** 9:00am-4:30pm, closed Fridays.
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours.
**Nearest metro:** Pragati Maidan (Blue Line).

The paths are flat and paved — stroller-friendly. A battery-operated vehicle (₹50) runs a circuit for tired legs. Bring water and sunscreen — shade is limited in some sections.

### Sunder Nursery & Lodhi Gardens

If your kids need open space to run, these two parks deliver. **Sunder Nursery** (₹30 entry, near Humayun's Tomb) has palm-lined paths, fountains, and enough open lawn for a cricket match. **Lodhi Gardens** (free) has Mughal tombs to climb around and a population of friendly squirrels.

Both work best in winter mornings (October-February). Summer heat makes outdoor time impractical after 10am.

### Adventure Island — Rohini

Delhi's biggest amusement park with roller coasters, water rides, and carnival-style games. It's not Six Flags, but for ages 5-14, it does the job.

**Entry:** ₹800-1,200 ($10-14.50) including all rides. Water park is extra (₹500-700).
**Hours:** 11:00am-7:00pm (weekdays), 11:00am-8:00pm (weekends).
**Getting there:** Rithala metro (Red Line), then auto-rickshaw.

Go on a weekday if possible — weekend queues for popular rides hit 30-40 minutes.

## Indoor Activities

### National Science Centre

Four floors of interactive science exhibits on Bhairon Road, near Pragati Maidan. The highlights for kids: a mirror maze, a section where you can generate electricity by pedalling a bike, 3D movie shows, and a gallery on human biology with hands-on models.

**Entry:** ₹80 ($1) for adults, ₹40 for children.
**Hours:** 10:00am-5:30pm, closed on major holidays.
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours.
**Nearest metro:** Pragati Maidan (Blue Line).

The gift shop sells science kits and models — budget ₹200-500 for the inevitable requests. This is one of the [best free-or-cheap things to do in Delhi](/delhi/best-free-things-to-do-in-delhi/) and works regardless of weather.

### National Rail Museum

A working miniature train carries passengers around a park full of vintage locomotives, including a 1855 steam engine and the Fairy Queen (the world's oldest working locomotive). Inside, there are model train displays and railway memorabilia.

**Entry:** ₹100 ($1.20) for adults, ₹20 for children. Toy train ride ₹30.
**Hours:** 10:00am-5:00pm, closed Mondays.
**Location:** Chanakyapuri, near Lok Kalyan Marg metro (Yellow Line).
**Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours.

This works for ages 3-10. Older kids may find it slow. The outdoor section has full-size trains you can climb on.

### Akshardham Temple

The BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham complex in East Delhi is genuinely impressive for all ages. The main temple is an architectural spectacle, but kids will care more about the **Sanskruti Vihar** — a 12-minute boat ride through animatronic dioramas depicting ancient Indian life — and the **Yagna Purush Kund** musical fountain show (evenings, 25 minutes, starts after sunset).

**Entry:** Free for the temple. Exhibition and boat ride ₹170 adults, ₹100 children.
**Hours:** 9:30am-6:30pm, closed Mondays.
**Nearest metro:** Akshardham (Blue Line).
**No phones, cameras, or bags allowed.** Lockers are available at the entrance (₹10-20).

The fountain show is the highlight — arrive by 5:30pm in winter to secure a good seat.

### KidZania — Noida

A miniature city where kids aged 4-16 take on adult roles — firefighter, doctor, journalist, chef — and earn play currency. It's the same franchise as the global chain, well-run, and reliably entertaining.

**Entry:** ₹1,000-1,500 ($12-18) per child, ₹600-800 for adults.
**Location:** DLF Mall of India, Sector 18, Noida. Take the Blue Line metro to Noida Sector 18.
**Time needed:** 3-4 hours.

Good for a [rainy day in Delhi](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-when-it-rains/) or when you need an air-conditioned escape.

## Tips For Families

**Timing matters.** October to February is comfortable for outdoor activities. March-May is brutally hot — stick to indoor spots and malls. July-September monsoon means humidity and occasional flooding.

**Carry snacks.** Delhi attractions often have overpriced, limited food options inside. Pack fruit, biscuits, and water bottles. Most venues allow outside food.

**Transport.** Uber and Ola are your best friends. The metro works well for central attractions (Zoo, Akshardham, Science Centre) but reaching Rohini or Noida requires longer rides. For a full-day itinerary, hire a car with driver for ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) — much easier with kids and car seats.

**Nap planning.** If you're travelling with under-5s, plan one major activity per half-day. Delhi's distances and traffic eat into schedules. A hotel break between 1-3pm keeps everyone functional.

**Safety.** Hold hands in crowded spaces (Old Delhi, metro stations). Carry a card with your hotel name and phone number in case anyone gets separated. For more detail, see our [3-day Delhi itinerary](/delhi/how-to-spend-3-days-in-delhi/) which includes family-friendly routing.
