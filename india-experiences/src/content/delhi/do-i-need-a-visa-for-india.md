  - question: "How do I apply for an India e-visa?"
    answer: "Apply at indianvisaonline.gov.in — the only official site. You'll need a passport valid for at least 6 months, a recent passport-size photo (white background, 2x2 inches), and the photo page scan of your passport. Fill in the online form, pay the fee ($25 for 30-day, $40 for 1-year, $80 for 5-year), and submit. Processing takes 72 hours on average. You'll receive the e-visa by email — print it and carry it with your passport. Apply at least 4 days before your flight, ideally a week."
  - question: "Which countries are eligible for India's e-visa?"
    answer: "Over 160 countries are eligible for the India e-visa, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Japan, and most EU nations. Notable exceptions include Pakistan and Bangladesh nationals, who must apply through an Indian embassy or consulate. Nepali and Bhutanese citizens don't need a visa at all. Check the full list at indianvisaonline.gov.in before applying."
  - question: "Can I extend my India e-visa?"
    answer: "The 30-day e-tourist visa cannot be extended. If you want to stay longer, apply for the 1-year or 5-year e-tourist visa before you travel — these allow stays of up to 90 days per visit (180 days for US citizens). If you overstay any visa, you'll face fines, possible detention, and future visa difficulties. For stays longer than 180 days, you need a regular tourist visa from an Indian embassy or consulate, which allows up to 10 years of validity with 180-day continuous stays."

**Most nationalities need a visa to enter India, and the e-visa is the fastest way to get one.** Over 160 countries are eligible to apply online at indianvisaonline.gov.in. The 30-day tourist e-visa costs $25, takes about 72 hours to process, and can be applied for at least 4 days before your departure date.

## E-Visa Types and Costs

India offers three e-tourist visa durations:

| Visa Type | Fee | Duration | Entries | Max Stay Per Visit |
|-----------|-----|----------|---------|-------------------|
| 30-day e-tourist | $25 | 30 days from arrival | Double entry | 30 days |
| 1-year e-tourist | $40 | 1 year from issue | Multiple entry | 90 days (180 for US) |
| 5-year e-tourist | $80 | 5 years from issue | Multiple entry | 90 days (180 for US) |

If you're visiting Delhi for a week or two, the 30-day visa is cheapest. If there's any chance you'll return to India within a year, the 1-year visa at $40 is better value and gives you flexibility.

**Fees vary by nationality.** Citizens of Japan, Singapore, and Sri Lanka pay $10 for the 30-day visa. Some nationalities pay more. The payment page shows your specific fee.

## How to Apply Step by Step

### 1. Go to the Official Website

The only legitimate site is **indianvisaonline.gov.in**. There are dozens of copycat sites that charge double or triple the fee for the same service. If the URL doesn't end in .gov.in, close the tab.

### 2. Gather Your Documents

- **Passport** valid for at least 6 months from your arrival date, with at least 2 blank pages
- **Digital passport photo** — white background, 2x2 inches (350x350 pixels minimum), JPEG format, under 1 MB
- **Passport photo page scan** — colour scan, JPEG or PDF, under 300 KB
- **Travel details** — your expected arrival date, port of entry (Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport is listed as "Delhi Airport"), and hotel address

### 3. Fill in the Application

The form takes 15-20 minutes. Some tips:

- **Applicant name** must match your passport exactly. Middle names go in the "surname" field if that's how your passport shows them.
- **Port of arrival:** Select "Delhi Airport" for IGI Airport.
- **Indian hotel address:** Enter your first night's accommodation. If you haven't booked yet, any Delhi hotel address works — they're not checking your booking.
- **Previous visa details:** If you've been to India before, have old visa numbers ready. If you can't find them, it's usually fine to say you haven't visited.

### 4. Pay and Submit

Pay by credit or debit card. The payment gateway occasionally fails — if it does, wait 30 minutes and try again. Don't submit the application multiple times or you may create duplicate entries.

### 5. Wait for Approval

Processing takes **72 hours on average**, but apply at least 4-7 days before travel. You'll receive the approved e-visa by email. Print a copy — immigration at [Delhi airport](/delhi/how-do-i-get-from-delhi-airport-to-the-city/) will ask to see it alongside your passport.

## Who Doesn't Need a Visa

- **Nepali and Bhutanese citizens** can enter India without a visa
- **Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders** have lifelong entry rights
- **Diplomatic and official passport holders** from some countries have visa-free agreements

## Who Can't Use the E-Visa

Citizens of **Pakistan** and **Bangladesh** must apply through an Indian embassy or consulate for a regular visa. A few other nationalities are also excluded — check the official site for the current list. If you're not eligible for the e-visa, the standard tourist visa application through your nearest Indian embassy takes 5-10 business days.

## At the Airport

When you land at Delhi's Terminal 3, head to the **e-visa immigration counters** — they're separate from the regular visa queues and usually faster. Have ready:

- Printed e-visa approval
- Passport
- Return or onward flight booking (sometimes asked, not always)
- Hotel booking confirmation (sometimes asked, not always)

Immigration will stamp your passport with the entry date. The whole process takes 10-30 minutes depending on queue length.

After clearing immigration, grab a [SIM card at the arrivals hall](/delhi/best-sim-card-for-tourists-in-delhi/) and head into the city.

## Common Mistakes

**Applying too late.** The 72-hour processing time is average, not guaranteed. Some applications take 5-7 days. Don't wait until the last minute.

**Using a fake website.** Search "India visa" and the first results are often paid intermediary sites charging $80-150 for a service that costs $25-80 directly. The official site is indianvisaonline.gov.in — bookmark it.

**Passport name mismatch.** If your application name doesn't match your passport exactly, you'll be rejected. Double-check every letter.

**Expired passport photos.** The photo upload has strict requirements. Use a white background, face the camera directly, and make sure the file is under 1 MB. Most phone photos work if you crop to a square against a white wall.

**Not printing the e-visa.** Technically the system is digital, but immigration officers at Delhi airport still ask to see a printed copy. Don't rely on your phone — print it.

## Regular (Sticker) Visa

If you need a longer stay, want to work or study in India, or aren't eligible for the e-visa, apply for a regular visa through your nearest Indian embassy or consulate. These are stamped or stickered directly into your passport.

- **Tourist visa (regular):** Up to 10-year validity, 180 days maximum continuous stay, multiple entry. Processing takes 5-10 business days. Fees vary by country.
- **Business visa:** For work purposes, conferences, etc. Requires an invitation letter.
- **Student, medical, and conference visas** are also available for specific purposes.

For most leisure travellers visiting Delhi, the e-visa is all you need. See our [packing guide](/delhi/what-should-i-pack-for-delhi/) for other pre-trip preparation.
