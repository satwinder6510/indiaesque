## What Things Actually Cost

Here's what you'll pay for the basics, with real prices from 2025-26:

### Accommodation

- **Hostel dorm bed:** ₹500-800 ($6-10) per night. Zostel and Moustache in Paharganj are popular. Madpackers in Lajpat Nagar is cleaner.
- **Budget hotel room:** ₹1,000-2,000 ($12-24). Karol Bagh and Paharganj have dozens of options. Expect basic but functional.

### Food

Food is where Delhi's value really shows.

- **Street food snack** (samosa, kachori, chaat): ₹20-50 ($0.25-0.60)
- **Full street food meal** (chole bhature, paratha plate, kebab roll): ₹80-150 ($1-1.80)
- **Local restaurant thali:** ₹150-300 ($1.80-3.60)
- **Mid-range restaurant** (Khan Market, Hauz Khas): ₹500-1,200 ($6-14) per person
- **Fine dining:** ₹3,000-8,000 ($36-95) per person

You can eat like a king at street level. A plate of chole bhature at **Sita Ram Diwan Chand** in Paharganj costs ₹80 ($1), and it's one of the best meals in the city. Butter chicken at **Moti Mahal** in Daryaganj — the restaurant that invented the dish — runs about ₹350 ($4.20).

### Transport

- **Metro ride:** ₹10-60 ($0.12-0.72) depending on distance
- **Metro tourist card (3-day):** ₹200 ($2.40) unlimited rides
- **Uber/Ola ride across the city (15-20 km):** ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80)
- **Auto-rickshaw (5 km via app):** ₹40-80 ($0.50-1)
- **Airport Express Metro to New Delhi station:** ₹60 ($0.72)

The metro is your best friend for keeping costs down. More detail in our [daily budget breakdown](/delhi/how-much-money-do-i-need-per-day-in-delhi/).

### Sightseeing

Here's the catch — India has a dual pricing system for monuments. Foreigners pay significantly more than Indian nationals.

- **Red Fort:** ₹550 ($6.50) foreigners / ₹35 ($0.40) Indians
- **Humayun's Tomb:** ₹550 ($6.50) foreigners / ₹35 ($0.40) Indians
- **Qutub Minar:** ₹550 ($6.50) foreigners / ₹35 ($0.40) Indians
- **Lodhi Gardens:** Free
- **Jama Masjid:** Free (₹300 camera fee)
- **Gurudwara Bangla Sahib:** Free
- **India Gate:** Free

A full day hitting three major ASI monuments costs ₹1,650 ($20) in entry fees alone. Budget for ₹2,000-2,500 ($24-30) per day for sightseeing if you're visiting multiple paid sites.

## Budget Tiers

### Backpacker Budget: ₹2,000-3,000/day ($24-36)

Hostel dorm, street food and thali restaurants, Delhi Metro for transport, one or two paid monuments per day. This is tight but absolutely doable. You'll eat well and see a lot.

### Comfortable Mid-Range: ₹5,000-10,000/day ($60-120)

Private hotel room in a decent area, mix of street food and sit-down restaurants, Uber for convenience, all the monuments you want. This is the sweet spot where Delhi feels easy without spending much.

### Luxury: ₹15,000-30,000+/day ($180-360+)

Five-star hotel, fine dining, private car with driver (₹3,000-5,000/day), guides at every site. Delhi's luxury tier is world-class and still a fraction of what you'd pay in London or New York.

## Where the Money Goes

Most travellers find accommodation is their biggest expense, followed by monument entry fees. Food and transport are almost negligibly cheap. A common pattern is spending ₹3,000 on a hotel room, ₹500 on food, ₹200 on transport, and ₹1,500 on entry fees — so the "experience" costs less than the bed.

One smart move: front-load your [food tours](/delhi/food-tours/) early in the trip. A guided food walk through Old Delhi costs ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) and shows you the stalls you'll eat at for the rest of your stay, saving money on restaurant meals.
