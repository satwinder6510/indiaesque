  - question: "What are the top things to do in South Delhi?"
    answer: "Visit Qutub Minar (Delhi's oldest monument, 12th century), walk through Lodhi Gardens (15th-century tombs surrounded by green lawns), browse Khan Market (Delhi's poshest shopping strip), explore Sunder Nursery (restored Mughal gardens near Humayun's Tomb), and see contemporary art at the Kiran Nadar Museum or NGMA. Mehrauli Archaeological Park near Qutub Minar has ruins spanning 1,000 years."
  - question: "Is South Delhi worth visiting?"
    answer: "Absolutely. South Delhi has a completely different feel from the dense, chaotic old city. It's where you'll find tree-lined avenues, Delhi's best restaurants and cafes, contemporary art galleries, and green spaces. The historical sites here — Qutub Minar, Lodhi Gardens, Mehrauli village — are less crowded than their Old Delhi counterparts and often more pleasant to explore."
  - question: "How do I get around South Delhi?"
    answer: "The Yellow Line Metro connects Hauz Khas and Qutub Minar stations. The Magenta Line serves Saket and parts of outer South Delhi. But South Delhi is more spread out than CP or Old Delhi, so you'll need Uber or Ola between sights. A full day of South Delhi sightseeing by Uber costs ₹600-1,000 in transport. Khan Market is best reached from Jor Bagh or Khan Market Metro station."

**South Delhi is where the city slows down — tree-lined avenues, 12th-century monuments, well-kept gardens, and Delhi's best restaurants replace the density and chaos of the old city.** Qutub Minar, Lodhi Gardens, Khan Market, and Sunder Nursery are the main draws, and you'll want at least a full day to do the area justice.

South Delhi sprawls from Lodhi Colony in the north to Chhatarpur in the south, covering a huge area. Unlike Old Delhi where everything is walkable, South Delhi requires some Uber rides between sights. The trade-off is that each location is quieter, greener, and easier to enjoy at your own pace.

## The Main Sights

### Qutub Minar

Delhi's oldest major monument — a 72.5-metre tall sandstone tower built in 1193 by Qutub-ud-din Aibak, the first Sultan of Delhi. The surrounding complex includes the Iron Pillar (which hasn't rusted in 1,600 years), the ruins of India's first mosque (Quwwat-ul-Islam), and beautifully carved sandstone screen walls.

**Entry:** ₹600 ($7.20) for foreigners, ₹35 for Indians. Open sunrise to sunset. Qutub Minar Metro station (Yellow Line) is a 5-minute walk.

**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours. Visit early morning for the best light and fewer tour groups. For more details, read our [Qutub Minar guide](/delhi/is-qutub-minar-worth-visiting/).

### Mehrauli Archaeological Park

A 5-minute walk from Qutub Minar, this park contains over 100 ruins spanning 1,000 years — from the Rajput Lal Kot fortifications (1060 AD) to Mughal-era tombs and British-period structures. Most tourists miss it entirely, which makes it one of the most rewarding spots in South Delhi for anyone interested in history.

**Entry:** Free. Open dawn to dusk. No facilities — bring water.

### Lodhi Gardens

A 90-acre landscaped park containing 15th-century tombs of the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties. The Mohammed Shah Tomb and Bara Gumbad are the standout structures, set among lawns, palm trees, and walking paths. Joggers, yoga practitioners, and families share the space with tourists photographing the tombs.

**Entry:** Free. Open 5 AM to 8 PM. Best in the early morning or late afternoon. Jor Bagh Metro station (Yellow Line) is the nearest, a 5-minute walk from the entrance.

**Combine with:** A 10-minute walk east takes you to Khan Market for lunch.

### Sunder Nursery

A beautifully restored 90-acre Mughal garden complex adjacent to Humayun's Tomb. Opened to the public in 2018, it features 15th and 16th-century tombs, landscaped gardens, a lake with lotus beds, and a palm-lined amphitheatre. It's less known than Lodhi Gardens but arguably more beautiful.

**Entry:** ₹35 ($0.42). Open 7 AM to 6 PM (closes at 5 PM in winter). The closest Metro is Jangpura (Violet Line), but it's easier to Uber here.

### Khan Market

Delhi's most upscale shopping strip — a single horseshoe-shaped lane packed with designer boutiques, international brands, excellent restaurants, and cafes. Come here for lunch (Perch, Big Chill, Ama), for bookshops (Bahrisons, Full Circle), and for Indian designer fashion.

Not a bargaining market — prices are fixed and premium. A meal runs ₹800-2,000 per person. Nearest Metro: Khan Market station (Violet Line).

### Art Galleries

South Delhi has Delhi's best contemporary art scene:

- **Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA)** in Saket — free entry, rotating exhibitions of modern Indian art
- **National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA)** near India Gate — permanent collection plus visiting shows
- **Gallery Espace** in Defence Colony — established contemporary gallery
- **Exhibit 320** in Lado Sarai — near Qutub Minar, representing emerging Indian artists

Lado Sarai village near Qutub Minar has a cluster of small galleries that makes for a good afternoon of gallery-hopping. Check our [street art guide](/delhi/where-to-see-street-art-in-delhi/) for the Lodhi Art District, Delhi's outdoor mural project.

## Where To Eat

South Delhi has the city's strongest restaurant scene:

- **Indian Accent** (The Lodhi) — innovative modern Indian cuisine, one of India's highest-rated restaurants. Book 2+ weeks ahead. ₹5,000-8,000 per person.
- **Perch** (Khan Market) — coffee and wine bar with excellent brunch
- **Big Chill** (Khan Market) — pasta, pizza, and Delhi's favourite cheesecake
- **Potbelly** (Shahpur Jat) — Bihari cuisine in a terrace setting, ₹800-1,200 per person
- **SodaBottleOpenerWala** (Khan Market) — Parsi food and kitsch decor

## Neighbourhoods Within South Delhi

**Hauz Khas** — ruins, nightlife, boutiques. Read our dedicated [Hauz Khas guide](/delhi/things-to-do-in-hauz-khas/).

**Shahpur Jat** — a former urban village now filled with independent fashion designers, cafes, and studios. Walk the narrow lanes to find labels you won't see in malls.

**Defence Colony and Greater Kailash** — residential colonies with market blocks serving excellent food. Defence Colony Market has some of South Delhi's best local restaurants.

**Saket** — home to Select Citywalk, Delhi's best shopping mall, and the KNMA art museum. A good rainy-day or high-AQI-day destination.

## Getting Around

The **Yellow Line Metro** connects Hauz Khas and Qutub Minar stations. **Violet Line** serves Khan Market, Jangpura, and INA (for INA Market and Dilli Haat). Between these lines, Uber and Ola fill the gaps for ₹100-250 per ride.

A practical South Delhi day: Start at Qutub Minar (morning), Uber to Lodhi Gardens (mid-morning), walk to Khan Market (lunch), Uber to Sunder Nursery or Humayun's Tomb (afternoon), then Hauz Khas for evening drinks.
