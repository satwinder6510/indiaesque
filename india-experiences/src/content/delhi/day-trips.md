Delhi sits at the centre of a web of highways and rail lines that reach some of northern India's most significant sites within a few hours. Agra and the Taj Mahal are the obvious draw, but Neemrana, Mathura, Bharatpur, and even Jaipur are reachable from Delhi in a day — with varying degrees of comfort and schedule tightness.

This guide covers the five best day trips from Delhi, with transport options, costs, timing, and honest assessments of whether each trip is actually worth doing in a single day. For your overall Delhi planning, see the [Delhi city guide](/delhi/).

## Agra and the Taj Mahal

**Distance:** 233 km south | **Travel time:** 1 hour 40 minutes by train, 3-4 hours by road | **Best for:** First-time India visitors, architecture lovers, photographers

Agra is the most popular day trip from Delhi and the most logistically feasible. The Taj Mahal alone justifies the journey — and despite what contrarians say, seeing it in person hits differently than any photograph suggests. The scale, the detail of the inlay work, the way the marble changes colour as the light shifts — you need to be standing in the garden to register it.

### By Train (Recommended)

The **Gatimaan Express** is the fastest and most comfortable option:

- **Delhi to Agra:** Departs Hazrat Nizamuddin station at 6:10am, arrives Agra Cantt at 7:50am. Travel time: 1 hour 40 minutes.
- **Agra to Delhi:** Departs Agra Cantt at 5:50pm, arrives Hazrat Nizamuddin at 7:30pm.
- **Cost:** ₹750-1,500 ($9-18) depending on class. Executive Chair Car (CC) is ₹1,500 and includes a meal onboard.

This schedule gives you nearly 10 hours in Agra — more than enough for the Taj Mahal (2-3 hours), Agra Fort (1-2 hours), and lunch.

**The Shatabdi Express** is another option, departing New Delhi station at 6:00am and arriving around 8:00am. The return leaves Agra at 8:15pm. Fares are similar. Check schedules on IRCTC (irctc.co.in) and book 30-60 days ahead — these trains sell out during peak season.

### By Road

The Yamuna Expressway connects Delhi to Agra in 3-4 hours (depending on where you start in Delhi and traffic getting out of the city). This option works if you want door-to-door flexibility and don't mind sitting in a car.

**Hiring a car with driver:** ₹3,500-5,000 ($42-60) for the round trip, including tolls and parking. The driver waits while you sightsee. This is the most convenient option for groups of 2-4 people.

**Uber Intercity:** Available from Delhi to Agra, typically ₹2,500-4,000 ($30-48) one way. Not great for day trips — you'd need to book a return separately.

### What To See In Agra

**Taj Mahal:** Entry is ₹1,100 ($13) for foreign tourists, ₹50 for Indians. Open sunrise to sunset, closed Fridays. The morning light (6:30-9:00am) is best for photography; the white marble glows gold at dawn. If you arrive on the Gatimaan Express, you can be at the gate by 8:30am.

**Agra Fort:** ₹600 ($7.50) for foreign tourists. A 15-minute auto-rickshaw ride from the Taj. This massive red sandstone fortress contains the marble palace where Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb — with a view of the Taj Mahal from his window. Allow 1-2 hours.

**Mehtab Bagh:** A garden across the Yamuna river with a direct view of the Taj Mahal's back. ₹300 ($3.75) for foreigners. Best at sunset, but if you're on the Gatimaan schedule, you won't have time. Skip it on a day trip.

**Lunch:** Pinch of Spice on Fatehabad Road is reliable and air-conditioned — a good reset between monuments. Budget ₹500-800 ($6-10) per person.

For the full breakdown, read our [Delhi to Agra day trip guide](/delhi/can-you-do-a-day-trip-from-delhi-to-agra/).

### Is A Day Trip Worth It?

Yes, without qualification. The Gatimaan Express schedule is comfortable, you get nearly 10 hours in Agra, and the Taj Mahal plus Agra Fort is a satisfying day. You'll be tired when you get back to Delhi, but not wrecked.

If you have two days to spare, staying overnight in Agra lets you see the Taj at sunrise (the best time) and visit Fatehpur Sikri, the abandoned Mughal capital 40 km west. But a day trip works perfectly.

## Neemrana Fort Palace

**Distance:** 122 km southwest | **Travel time:** 2-2.5 hours by road | **Best for:** Couples, heritage hotel fans, families with kids

Neemrana Fort Palace is a 15th-century Rajput fort perched on a hillside in the Aravalli foothills. In the 1990s, it was restored and converted into a heritage hotel — the rooms are built into the fort walls, and the stepped pool looks out over the plains below. You don't need to be a hotel guest to visit for the day.

### Getting There

There's no train to Neemrana. By car, it's 2-2.5 hours from central Delhi via NH48 (the Jaipur highway). Hire a car with driver for ₹2,500-3,500 ($30-42) round trip, or drive yourself if you've rented a car.

### What To Do

**Day visit:** Non-guests can visit for lunch (buffet at Aman restaurant, approximately ₹2,000/$25 per person) or use the pool and common areas with a day package (₹3,000-4,000/$36-48 per person, which includes the buffet). The fort itself is the attraction — 10 levels of courtyards, terraces, hanging gardens, and restored rooms. You can wander the ramparts and get excellent photographs.

**Zip-lining:** Neemrana runs a zip-line across the fort's valley — five zip lines covering 400 metres total. It costs ₹2,000-2,500 ($25-30) per person and takes about 45 minutes. This is the main reason families visit — kids love it.

**Combined with Jaipur road:** Neemrana sits on the Delhi-Jaipur highway. If you're driving to Jaipur, it makes a logical lunch stop. Pull in for 2-3 hours and continue.

For the complete guide, see [Is Neemrana Fort worth visiting?](/delhi/is-neemrana-fort-worth-visiting-from-delhi/)

### Is A Day Trip Worth It?

Yes, especially for couples or families. The fort is atmospheric, the lunch is solid, and the zip-lining gives kids something active to do. It's a clean half-day trip — leave Delhi by 9:00am, arrive by 11:30am, spend 3-4 hours at the fort, and be back in Delhi by 6:00pm.

## Mathura and Vrindavan

**Distance:** 180 km south | **Travel time:** 3-3.5 hours by road, 2 hours by train | **Best for:** Temple culture, religious festivals, photography

Mathura is the birthplace of Lord Krishna, and Vrindavan (15 km north of Mathura) is where he is said to have spent his childhood. Together, they form one of Hinduism's holiest pilgrimage circuits. For travellers, they offer a total contrast to Delhi — the pace is slower, the colours are more intense, and the devotion is visible in every lane.

### Getting There

**By train:** Several trains run from Delhi to Mathura Junction daily. The fastest take 1.5-2 hours. Fares are ₹150-400 ($2-5) depending on class. Check IRCTC for schedules.

**By road:** 3-3.5 hours via the Yamuna Expressway. Hire a car with driver for ₹3,000-4,500 ($36-54) round trip.

### What To See

**Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple Complex (Mathura):** The traditional site of Krishna's birth. The temple complex is modern, but the prison cell where Krishna is believed to have been born is underground and ancient. Free entry. No phones, cameras, or bags allowed inside — lockers are available at the gate for ₹10-20.

**Banke Bihari Temple (Vrindavan):** One of the most visited temples in India. The Krishna deity is dressed in elaborate outfits that change daily. The temple gets extremely crowded — visit early morning (before 9:00am) or late afternoon for a less packed experience.

**ISKCON Temple (Vrindavan):** The Hare Krishna movement's main Indian temple. Clean, well-organised, and foreigner-friendly. They serve a free vegetarian lunch to all visitors.

**Ghats along the Yamuna:** Mathura's river ghats are beautiful at dawn and dusk. Vishram Ghat is the main one — the evening aarti (prayer ceremony) with oil lamps on the river is worth timing your visit around.

For the full itinerary, read our [Mathura and Vrindavan day trip guide](/delhi/day-trip-to-mathura-and-vrindavan-from-delhi/).

### When To Visit

Mathura and Vrindavan are worth visiting any time, but they come alive during festivals. **Holi** (February/March) in Vrindavan is the most famous colour festival in India — weeks of celebrations culminating in a massive colour-throwing party. **Janmashtami** (August/September), Krishna's birthday, draws millions of pilgrims over two days.

### Is A Day Trip Worth It?

Yes, if temples and religious culture interest you. The journey is longer than Agra — 3-3.5 hours each way — so you'll have about 5-6 hours on the ground. That's enough for the main temples in both towns. If you're not particularly interested in temple culture, this trip will feel like a lot of driving for what you see.

## Jaipur

**Distance:** 280 km southwest | **Travel time:** 4.5-6 hours by road, 4.5 hours by train | **Best for:** First-time India visitors wanting to see the Pink City

Jaipur is technically possible as a day trip from Delhi, but we recommend against it. The 5-6 hours of travel each way (by road; the train is slightly faster but still 4.5 hours) leaves you only 4-5 hours in the city, which isn't enough to see Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal, and the City Palace properly.

### If You Must Do It In A Day

**By train:** The Shatabdi Express departs New Delhi at 6:05am, arrives Jaipur at 10:30am. The return departs Jaipur at 5:50pm, arriving Delhi at 10:40pm. This gives you about 7 hours in Jaipur — tight but workable if you hire a car locally and hit Amber Fort and the City Palace.

**By car:** Leave Delhi by 5:00am to beat the morning traffic. You'll reach Jaipur by 10:30-11:00am. Leave Jaipur by 4:00pm to arrive back in Delhi by 9:00-10:00pm. A hired car with driver for the round trip costs ₹5,000-7,000 ($60-84).

For the full analysis, see our [Delhi to Jaipur day trip guide](/delhi/can-you-do-a-day-trip-from-delhi-to-jaipur/).

### The Better Option

Stay one night. Hotels in Jaipur start at ₹1,500 ($18) for a decent room and ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) for a heritage haveli. One night gives you an afternoon for Amber Fort, an evening for the old city bazaars, and a morning for the City Palace and Hawa Mahal. It turns a rushed day trip into a relaxed two-day excursion.

## Bharatpur (Keoladeo National Park)

**Distance:** 195 km south | **Travel time:** 3-4 hours by road, 3-3.5 hours by train | **Best for:** Birdwatchers, nature lovers, photography

Keoladeo Ghana National Park in Bharatpur is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the finest bird sanctuaries in Asia. October to February is peak season, when migratory birds — including Siberian cranes (when they come), painted storks, cormorants, kingfishers, and dozens of species of ducks — fill the wetlands.

### Getting There

**By train:** Bharatpur Junction is on the Delhi-Mumbai line. Several trains take 3-3.5 hours. The early morning Shatabdi that goes to Agra also stops at Bharatpur.

**By road:** 3-4 hours via NH-2 and the Yamuna Expressway. Can be combined with an Agra visit — Bharatpur is only 55 km west of Agra.

### What To Do

**Park entry:** ₹500 ($6) for foreigners, ₹75 for Indians. Cycle rickshaws inside the park cost ₹100-200/hour and are the best way to cover ground without disturbing the birds. Official guides cost ₹250-400 for a 3-4 hour walk.

The park covers 29 square km, but the main birding circuit is a 10 km loop through marshes, woodland, and grassland. Serious birders spend the entire day; casual visitors need 3-4 hours.

**Best time:** Early morning (6:00-10:00am) when birds are most active and the light is best for photography. This means leaving Delhi very early — 4:00-5:00am — or staying overnight in Bharatpur (basic hotels from ₹1,000/$12).

### Is A Day Trip Worth It?

For dedicated birdwatchers, yes — but be prepared for a long day. Leave Delhi by 5:00am, arrive by 8:00-9:00am, spend 4-5 hours in the park, and drive back. You'll return to Delhi by 6:00-7:00pm.

For casual visitors, combine it with an Agra trip — do the Taj Mahal in the morning, drive to Bharatpur (1 hour) for an afternoon in the park, and drive back to Delhi from there (3-4 hours). This makes the two-site day trip more efficient, but it's a very full day.
