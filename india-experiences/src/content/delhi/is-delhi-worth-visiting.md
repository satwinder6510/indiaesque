  - question: "Why do people skip Delhi when visiting India?"
    answer: "Many travellers treat Delhi as a transit point to Agra, Jaipur, or Rajasthan. The city has a reputation for pollution, scams, and aggressive touts, which puts some people off. But skipping Delhi means missing India's best street food, Mughal architecture that rivals the Taj Mahal, and a city with more historical layers than almost anywhere on earth."
  - question: "What makes Delhi different from other Indian cities?"
    answer: "Delhi has been the capital of at least seven successive empires, and each one built a new city on top of the last. No other Indian city has this density of historical layers. It's also the only place where Mughal monuments, colonial British architecture, and modern India all exist within a few kilometres of each other. The food culture draws from every region of India."
  - question: "Is Delhi better than Mumbai for tourists?"
    answer: "Delhi and Mumbai are completely different experiences. Delhi is better for historical monuments, Mughal architecture, and street food. Mumbai is better for nightlife, waterfront views, and Bollywood culture. For a first-time visitor to India who wants history and food, Delhi is the stronger choice. If you want modern India's energy, Mumbai edges ahead."

**Yes, Delhi is absolutely worth visiting, but you need to arrive with the right expectations.** It's not a relaxing beach destination or a picture-perfect European capital. Delhi is loud, crowded, occasionally overwhelming, and deeply rewarding if you lean into it.

The honest version: Delhi polarises people. Some travellers arrive and feel assaulted by the noise and traffic. Others arrive and feel like they've walked into the most alive place they've ever experienced. The difference usually comes down to preparation, timing, and mindset.

## What Makes Delhi Worth the Effort

### The Food Alone Justifies the Trip

Delhi has the most diverse and concentrated food culture of any city in India. It's where butter chicken was invented (Moti Mahal, Daryaganj, 1950s). It's where Mughlai kebab traditions from the 16th century still run in the same families. It's where street food vendors in **Chandni Chowk** serve dahi bhalla, chaat, jalebis, and paranthas that cost ₹50-150 ($0.60-1.80) and taste better than most restaurant meals.

Every region of India is represented in Delhi's restaurants. South Indian dosas in Sarojini Nagar. Bengali fish in CR Park. Tibetan momos in Majnu Ka Tilla. Rajasthani thalis in Connaught Place. You could eat three meals a day for two weeks and never repeat a cuisine.

A guided [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) through Old Delhi is one of the best single activities available in any Indian city.

### 1,000 Years of Architecture on One Map

Most tourist cities have one era of architecture. Delhi has at least five, and you can visit them all in a single day:

- **12th century**: Qutub Minar and the first Delhi Sultanate structures in Mehrauli
- **14th century**: Tughlaqabad Fort, a massive abandoned fortress in South Delhi
- **16th-17th century**: Humayun's Tomb, Red Fort, Jama Masjid — the peak of Mughal architecture
- **1920s-1930s**: Lutyens' New Delhi — India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Connaught Place
- **21st century**: Akshardham Temple, the Lotus Temple, modern Hauz Khas

The detail on [what Delhi is best known for](/delhi/what-is-delhi-best-known-for/) goes deeper into the architecture and history.

### Real India at Full Volume

If you want to understand India — not a curated resort version, but the actual country — Delhi is the place to start. The city runs on controlled chaos. Autos honk through traffic circles. Street vendors shout prices. Temples, mosques, and gurdwaras sit side by side. Business districts back onto medieval lanes.

This intensity is the point. Delhi doesn't perform for tourists. It exists at its own pace, and you're welcome to join, but it won't slow down for you. That honesty is what makes it more rewarding than purpose-built tourist destinations.

## What Delhi Does Not Offer

Being honest about what Delhi lacks helps you set expectations:

**It's not scenic in the traditional sense.** There are no mountains, beaches, or rolling countryside. The beauty is architectural and human, not natural. Lodhi Gardens and the Yamuna riverfront offer some green space, but Delhi is fundamentally urban.

**Air quality is a real issue.** From November to January, Delhi's pollution spikes to dangerous levels. The sky turns grey, visibility drops, and being outside for long periods can irritate your throat and eyes. If you're sensitive to air quality, plan your visit for February-March or October when pollution is lower.

**It requires stamina.** Walking through Old Delhi in the afternoon heat, negotiating with auto drivers, and navigating crowds at popular monuments takes energy. If you prefer slow, quiet travel, Delhi will test you.

**Scams exist.** Touts at the train station and airport may try to redirect you to their preferred hotels or tour companies. Overly friendly strangers near major monuments sometimes have an agenda. These are avoidable with basic awareness — read our guide on [staying safe in Delhi](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/).

## Who Should Visit Delhi

**First-time India visitors**: Delhi is the best introduction to India's scale and diversity. Starting here calibrates your senses for the rest of the country.

**History and architecture lovers**: Delhi has more historical monuments than most countries. Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites within city limits, and hundreds of unlisted ruins scattered through parks and neighbourhoods.

**Food travellers**: If eating is a core part of how you travel, Delhi belongs on your list. Period.

**Travellers heading to Agra or Rajasthan**: Delhi is the natural gateway. Spending 2-3 days here before heading south or west makes logistical sense, and the city earns those days on its own merits.

## Who Might Want to Skip Delhi

**If you only have one week in India** and care more about the Taj Mahal and Rajasthan palaces, you could fly into Delhi, catch a train to Agra or Jaipur, and save Delhi for a return trip. But you'd miss a lot.

**If severe pollution affects your health**, avoid November-January entirely. Delhi in February or October is a completely different proposition.

**If you want a relaxing holiday**, Goa, Kerala, or the Himalayas are better fits. Delhi is stimulating, not restful.

## When to Go

Timing matters enormously in Delhi. October through March is the peak season for good reason — temperatures are comfortable (10-25 degrees C) and the monsoon is over. April through June hits 40-47 degrees C, which makes sightseeing genuinely painful.
