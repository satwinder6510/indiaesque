  - question: "What should I see in Delhi in one day?"
    answer: "Start with Red Fort and Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi (morning), move to Humayun's Tomb and Lodhi Gardens (afternoon), and finish at Connaught Place (evening). This route flows south through the city and avoids backtracking. Use the Delhi Metro between stops to save time."
  - question: "Can I see the Taj Mahal and Delhi in one day?"
    answer: "It's technically possible but exhausting and not recommended. The Taj Mahal is a 3-hour drive or 2-hour train ride each way from Delhi. If you only have one day, spend it properly in Delhi. If you have two days, use the second for an Agra day trip on the Gatimaan Express."
  - question: "How do I get around Delhi in one day?"
    answer: "Use the Delhi Metro for long distances — it's fast, air-conditioned, and costs ₹10-60 per ride. Between nearby sites, use Uber or Ola auto-rickshaws (₹50-150 per trip). Avoid street taxis and cycle rickshaws for longer distances, though cycle rickshaws are fine in Old Delhi's narrow lanes."

**One day in Delhi is a sprint, but you can cover Old Delhi's Mughal heritage, the major New Delhi monuments, and still have time for a proper dinner.** The key is starting early, using the metro, and accepting that you'll barely scratch the surface.

## The Route Logic

This itinerary moves roughly north to south through the city: Old Delhi first, then Central Delhi, then South Delhi. This avoids doubling back and follows a natural flow. You'll cover about 25 km total, mostly by metro and auto-rickshaw.

## Morning: Old Delhi (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### 8:00 AM - Red Fort

Get to **Red Fort** (Lal Qila) before it opens at 9:30 AM — use the time to walk along the fort's massive sandstone walls and watch Old Delhi wake up. The chai stalls outside the fort serve tea for ₹10-20 ($0.12-0.24).

Once inside (₹550 / $6.50 for foreign visitors), head straight to the **Diwan-i-Khas** (Hall of Private Audience) with its famous inscription about paradise. The museum inside the Mumtaz Mahal building has Mughal miniature paintings and calligraphy. Don't spend more than 75 minutes — you have ground to cover.

### 10:00 AM - Chandni Chowk

Exit Red Fort through Lahori Gate and you're on **Chandni Chowk**, one of the oldest and most chaotic market streets in Asia. The road was laid out in 1650 by Jahanara, Shah Jahan's daughter.

Walk west along the main road. Stop at **Natraj Dahi Bhalle** near the Old Famous Jalebiwalah for dahi bhalla chaat — ₹80 ($1). If you're hungry for more, duck into **Paranthe Wali Gali** for stuffed paranthas deep-fried in ghee (₹100-150 / $1.20-1.80 each).

### 11:00 AM - Jama Masjid

Walk 10 minutes south to **Jama Masjid**. This is the largest mosque in India, built by Shah Jahan in 1656. Entry is free. Climb the southern minaret for ₹100 ($1.20) — the view across Old Delhi's rooftops is the best in the neighbourhood.

Note: Jama Masjid closes during prayer times (roughly 12:15-1:30 PM), so aim to visit before noon.

## Afternoon: New Delhi Monuments (12:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

### 12:30 PM - Transit to Humayun's Tomb

Take the [Delhi Metro](/delhi/how-to-use-delhi-metro/) Yellow Line from **Chandni Chowk station** south to **JLN Stadium station** (about 25 minutes, ₹30). From there, it's a 10-minute auto ride to the tomb entrance.

### 1:00 PM - Humayun's Tomb

This is arguably Delhi's single most important monument. Built in 1570, it's the first grand Mughal garden tomb and the direct inspiration for the Taj Mahal. The red sandstone and white marble structure sits in formal Charbagh gardens that feel like a different city from the chaos outside.

Entry is ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign visitors. Spend 60-90 minutes here. The main tomb gets the attention, but walk through the full complex — **Isa Khan's tomb** near the entrance and the **Arab Serai** gateway are excellent.

### 2:30 PM - Lodhi Gardens

A short auto ride (₹40-50) takes you to **Lodhi Gardens**, a 90-acre park filled with 15th-century tombs. Free entry. This is where Delhi's politicians, joggers, and diplomats all converge on the walking paths.

The **Bara Gumbad** and **Sheesh Gumbad** are the two major tombs inside the park. Walk the path along the south side for the best views. Thirty to forty-five minutes is enough.

### 3:30 PM - Lunch

You'll be starving by now. Head to **Khan Market** (10 minutes by auto from Lodhi Gardens) for a sit-down meal. **Perch** does excellent coffee and light European dishes. **Amici** has reliable Italian. Budget ₹800-1,200 ($10-15) per person.

If you want something faster and cheaper, the **Pandara Road** market near India Gate has dhabas (casual restaurants) serving North Indian food for ₹300-500 ($3.60-6).

## Evening: Connaught Place and India Gate (5:00 PM - 9:00 PM)

### 5:00 PM - India Gate

Drive or auto to **India Gate**, the 42-metre war memorial at the eastern end of Kartavya Path. The lawns around India Gate fill up in the late afternoon with families, ice cream vendors, and balloon sellers. Walk the length of **Kartavya Path** towards Rashtrapati Bhavan for the grand Lutyens vista.

### 6:00 PM - Agrasen Ki Baoli

A 15-minute walk north from India Gate brings you to **Agrasen Ki Baoli** on Hailey Road. This 14th-century stepwell descends 108 steps underground and is one of Delhi's most photogenic spots. Free entry. Best visited in the late afternoon when the light angles down the steps.

### 7:00 PM - Connaught Place

Walk to **Connaught Place** (locally called CP), Delhi's colonial-era commercial hub. The white-pillared circular arcade dates to the 1930s and houses everything from Wenger's bakery (since 1926) to modern cocktail bars.

For dinner, **Farzi Cafe** does modern Indian food with theatric presentation (₹1,200-1,800 / $14-22 per person). **Kake Da Hotel** on the outer circle is a no-frills Punjabi restaurant that's been serving butter chicken since 1931 — ₹500-700 ($6-8.50) per person.

### 8:30 PM - Wrap Up

If you still have energy, walk around the inner circle of CP for some shopping. **The People & Co** is good for a late drink. Or head to **Janpath Market** (closes around 8:30 PM) for cheap souvenirs and cotton clothing.

## Practical Tips for One Day

**Book Uber or Ola, not street autos.** App-based rides are metered and air-conditioned. Street auto drivers will quote inflated prices to tourists.

**Carry cash.** Smaller shops, street food stalls, and some monument ticket counters don't accept cards. Keep ₹2,000-3,000 ($24-36) in small notes.

**Dress for temples and mosques.** Cover your shoulders and knees for Jama Masjid. Remove shoes before entering. Carry a light scarf in your bag.

**Wear comfortable shoes.** You'll walk 15,000-20,000 steps today across uneven cobblestones, marble floors, and park paths.

## What Should I See in Delhi in One Day?

Start with Red Fort and Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi (morning), move to Humayun's Tomb and Lodhi Gardens (afternoon), and finish at Connaught Place (evening). This route flows south through the city and avoids backtracking. Use the Delhi Metro between stops to save time.

## Can I See the Taj Mahal and Delhi in One Day?

It's technically possible but exhausting and not recommended. The Taj Mahal is a 3-hour drive or 2-hour train ride each way from Delhi. If you only have one day, spend it properly in Delhi. If you have two days, use the second for an Agra day trip on the Gatimaan Express.
