**The safest and most enjoyable way to celebrate Holi in Delhi as a tourist is at an organised event — hotel-hosted parties, ticketed music festivals, or curated cultural experiences — rather than jumping into random street celebrations.** In 2026, Holi falls on Tuesday, 10 March, with the Holika Dahan bonfire on the evening of 9 March.

Street Holi in Delhi can be chaotic. People throw coloured powder, water balloons, and buckets of dyed water at anyone walking by. Alcohol flows freely, and things can get aggressive, especially towards women and foreigners. That doesn't mean you should skip Holi entirely — it means you should pick your celebration carefully.

## Organised Hotel Holi Parties

Several of Delhi's top hotels host Holi events with organic colours, DJ sets, food and drinks, and a controlled environment. These typically run from 10:00 AM to 3:00 or 4:00 PM on the day of Holi.

### The Lalit New Delhi

One of Delhi's most popular hotel Holi events. The Lalit hosts an annual celebration in its garden area with a DJ, rain dance setup, organic colours, and a brunch-style buffet. Tickets generally cost ₹4,000-6,000 ($48-72) per person including food and drinks. The crowd is a mix of hotel guests, expats, and Delhi residents. Book through the hotel directly or watch for announcements on their social media in February.

### ITC Maurya

ITC Maurya runs a more upscale Holi brunch in its courtyard. Expect curated food (ITC's kitchens are among Delhi's finest), premium drinks, live music, and coloured powder distributed to guests. Pricing is typically ₹5,000-8,000 ($60-96) per person. The atmosphere is more refined than the mass-market events — a good choice if you want the Holi experience without getting completely drenched.

### Pullman New Delhi Aerocity

A newer addition to the hotel Holi circuit. Pullman hosts a pool-adjacent Holi party with music, organic colours, and an international buffet. Expect to pay around ₹3,500-5,000 ($42-60). Convenient if you're staying near the airport.

### The Oberoi, New Delhi

The Oberoi typically offers a more intimate Holi celebration for its guests, with traditional thandai drinks (a spiced milk beverage associated with Holi), sweets, and a curated colour experience. Contact the hotel directly for current-year details and pricing.

## Ticketed Holi Music Festivals

Delhi sees several large-scale Holi-themed music festivals each year. These are outdoor events with stages, DJs, colour throws, and food stalls. Popular ones include:

- **Holi Moo Festival** — usually held at a farmhouse venue in South Delhi. Multiple music stages, colour powder cannons, food trucks, and a young crowd. Tickets range from ₹1,500-3,500 ($18-42) depending on the tier.
- **Colour Me Mad** — another large ticketed event with electronic music and colour throws. Check social media for 2026 dates and venue.
- **Holi Reloaded** — held at various venues over the years. DJ-heavy, high-energy, and popular with college-age crowds.

Tickets for these events usually go on sale 3-4 weeks before Holi through BookMyShow or Insider.in. Early bird pricing saves 20-30%.

## Community and Cultural Holi Experiences

If you want something more authentic than a hotel party, a few options bridge the gap between street chaos and sanitised events:

**Neighbourhood celebrations in South Delhi colonies** — areas like Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, and Vasant Kunj have community Holi gatherings in parks or colony common areas. These are family-friendly, use mostly organic colours, and include home-cooked food. If you're staying with a local family or have Indian friends, ask to join. These are the most genuine Holi experiences in Delhi.

**Temple celebrations** — ISKCON Temple in East of Kailash holds a Holi celebration with flower petals and organic colours. Banke Bihari's Delhi followers sometimes organise flower Holi events. These tend to be gentler and more spiritual than the street version.

## The Mathura Day Trip Option

For the most intense Holi experience in India, consider a day trip to Mathura and Vrindavan, about 160 km (3 hours) south of Delhi. This is Lord Krishna's birthplace, and Holi here is celebrated for a full week with processions, temple ceremonies, and the famous Lathmar Holi in nearby Barsana where women playfully beat men with sticks.

Several Delhi tour operators run Holi day trips to Mathura departing at 5:00-6:00 AM and returning by evening. Expect to pay ₹2,500-5,000 ($30-60) for a group tour with transport. Check our guide to [day trips from Delhi to Mathura and Vrindavan](/delhi/day-trip-to-mathura-and-vrindavan-from-delhi/) for full details.

## What to Wear and Bring

**Clothing**: Wear white or light-coloured clothes you don't mind ruining. Cotton is better than synthetic — colours wash out of cotton more easily. Old t-shirt and shorts or loose pants are ideal.

**Footwear**: Wear closed shoes or old sandals you can throw away. Avoid flip-flops (they'll slip off in the chaos).

**Leave at the hotel**: Expensive watch, good sunglasses, jewellery, and your nice phone case. Bring your phone in a waterproof pouch or ziplock bag for photos.

**Bring**: Sunscreen (apply before going out — it also helps colours wash off skin more easily), a small towel, and a change of clothes. Moisturise your skin heavily the night before; oiled skin releases colour more easily.

**For your hair**: Apply coconut oil generously to your hair before heading out. This prevents colours from bonding to your hair and makes washing much easier later.

## Safety Tips for Tourists

Holi is a wonderful experience when you plan it right. Here's how to stay safe:

- **Go with a group** — never celebrate Holi alone on the streets, especially women and solo travellers. See our general [safety guide for tourists in Delhi](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/).
- **Stick to organic colours** — chemical colours (especially silver and dark green) can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. Organised events use organic colours. If buying your own, look for herbal or organic labels.
- **Watch your drinks** — during Holi, bhang (cannabis-infused thandai) is widely consumed. Don't accept drinks from strangers unless you know exactly what's in them.
- **Keep your mouth and eyes protected** — wear sunglasses and try not to breathe in large clouds of colour powder. If colour gets in your eyes, rinse with clean water.
- **Transport home** — pre-book your return transport. Autos and cabs are hard to find during peak Holi hours (noon-3 PM). Most Uber drivers stop working during Holi.

## After Holi: Getting the Colour Off

Expect to spend 30-45 minutes scrubbing in the shower. Baby oil or coconut oil helps lift stubborn colour from skin. Avoid scrubbing aggressively — some colours will fade over 2-3 days naturally. For hair, a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing helps. Your nails will likely be stained for a few days regardless.

## When Is Holi in 2026?

Holi falls on Tuesday, 10 March 2026. Holika Dahan (the bonfire night) is on Monday, 9 March. The main colour-throwing celebration (Dhulandi) takes place on the morning and afternoon of 10 March. Most organised events run from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

## Is Holi Safe for Tourists in Delhi?

Holi can be safe for tourists if you choose the right setting. Organised hotel events and ticketed parties use organic colours and have security. Street celebrations in residential areas can be rough — strangers may throw water balloons, use chemical-based colours, or get aggressive with alcohol. Stick to organised events, go in a group, and leave valuables at your hotel.
