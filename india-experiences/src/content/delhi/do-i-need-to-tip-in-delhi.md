  - question: "How much should I tip at restaurants in Delhi?"
    answer: "If the bill doesn't include a service charge, tip 10% of the total. Many upscale restaurants add a 10% service charge automatically — check the bill before tipping on top. At casual sit-down restaurants, rounding up by ₹50-100 is fine. At street food stalls and dhabas, tipping isn't expected at all."
  - question: "Should I tip auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi?"
    answer: "Tipping auto drivers isn't expected in Delhi. If the driver used the meter or stuck to the agreed fare without hassle, rounding up to the nearest ₹10 is a nice gesture but not required. For example, if the fare is ₹73, pay ₹80. Don't tip drivers who tried to overcharge or took a longer route."
  - question: "How much do I tip a tour guide in Delhi?"
    answer: "For a half-day guided tour (3-4 hours), tip ₹200-500 ($2.40-6) per person. For a full-day private guide, ₹500-1,000 ($6-12) is appropriate. Hotel porters and bellboys expect ₹50-100 per bag. Housekeeping staff appreciate ₹50-100 per day left on the bedside table."

**Tip 10% at sit-down restaurants if there's no service charge already on the bill, round up small amounts for auto drivers, and give ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) to hotel porters and guides.** Tipping in Delhi isn't as mandatory as in the US, but it's appreciated and makes a real difference to workers earning low wages.

India doesn't have a rigid tipping culture, and nobody will chase you down the street if you don't tip. But tourism and hospitality workers rely on tips to supplement modest salaries, and knowing the local norms helps you be generous without overpaying.

## Restaurants

### Upscale and Mid-Range Restaurants

Check your bill first. Many Delhi restaurants — especially in areas like Khan Market, Hauz Khas, and Connaught Place — add a **10% service charge** automatically. It's printed on the bill as "Service Charge" or "SC." If it's there, you don't need to tip additionally, though leaving an extra ₹100-200 for exceptional service is welcome.

If there's **no service charge**, tip 10% of the total. On a ₹2,000 meal, that's ₹200. On a ₹800 lunch, ₹80-100 works. Leave it in cash on the table — even if you pay the bill by card, cash tips go directly to the staff rather than through the restaurant's accounting.

### Casual Restaurants and Dhabas

At budget restaurants (the kind with plastic chairs and laminated menus), rounding up the bill is enough. If lunch costs ₹230, leave ₹250. Nobody expects a percentage-based tip at a ₹150 thali place.

### Street Food Stalls

**Don't tip at street food stalls.** It's not the norm, and vendors may be confused by it. If you're on a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) and your guide takes you to a stall, your guide handles payment and the tour fee covers tips.

### Cafes and Coffee Shops

Most cafes in Delhi have a tip jar near the counter. Dropping ₹10-20 in there is common but not expected. At table-service cafes, treat it like a casual restaurant — round up or leave 10% on larger bills.

## Transport

### Auto Rickshaws

Not expected. If you agreed on a fare before the ride and the driver took you there without drama, rounding up to the nearest ₹10 is appreciated. Fare is ₹73? Pay ₹80. Fare is ₹142? Pay ₹150. Don't tip drivers who overcharged, took a longer route, or argued about the fare.

### Uber and Ola

Both apps give you the option to tip through the app after the ride. Most locals don't tip Uber/Ola drivers. If you want to, ₹20-50 is generous. Cash tips are fine too — just hand it over when you exit.

### Hotel Car Service

If your hotel arranges a car and driver for the day, tip the driver ₹300-500 ($3.60-6) for a full day of driving. If they've been particularly helpful — carrying bags, waiting patiently, suggesting good stops — go higher.

## Hotels

### Porters and Bellboys

₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) per bag is standard. Hand it directly to the person carrying your bags.

### Housekeeping

₹50-100 per day, left on the bedside table or in an envelope marked "housekeeping." Leave it daily rather than as a lump sum at the end — housekeeping staff rotate, and the person who cleaned your room should get the tip.

### Room Service

If your bill doesn't include a service charge, tip ₹50-100. If it does, nothing additional is needed.

### Concierge

If the concierge books you something useful — a hard-to-get restaurant reservation, a specific [Delhi budget tip](/delhi/is-delhi-expensive/), or arranges a day trip — ₹200-500 at the end of your stay is appropriate.

## Guides and Tours

### Group Tours

On a group walking tour or [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/), tip ₹100-300 ($1.20-3.60) per person to the guide. If there's an assistant or driver, ₹50-100 each.

### Private Guides

For a half-day tour: ₹200-500 ($2.40-6) per person. For a full day: ₹500-1,000 ($6-12) per person. Exceptional guides who clearly know their material and went beyond the script deserve the higher end.

### Monument "Guides"

If an unsolicited guide attaches themselves to you at a monument and you didn't ask for their help, you don't owe them anything. See our guide on [how to avoid scams in Delhi](/delhi/how-to-avoid-scams-in-delhi/) for more on this.

## Other Situations

- **Spa or salon service:** 10% if no service charge
- **Delivery (Zomato/Swiggy):** ₹20-30 through the app, optional
- **Petrol station attendant:** Not expected
- **Bathroom attendants at restaurants:** ₹10-20
