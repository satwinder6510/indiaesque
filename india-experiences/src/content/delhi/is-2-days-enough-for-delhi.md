  - question: "Can I see Delhi's main sights in 2 days?"
    answer: "Yes. In two days you can visit Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, India Gate, and Connaught Place. You'll need to start early each morning and use the metro to avoid traffic. It's tight but doable if you prioritise."
  - question: "Should I extend my Delhi trip to 3 days?"
    answer: "If your schedule allows it, absolutely. A third day lets you explore South Delhi neighbourhoods like Hauz Khas and Lodhi Colony, take a food tour through Old Delhi's lanes, or do a day trip to Agra. Two days covers monuments; three days lets you actually feel the city."
  - question: "What should I skip if I only have 2 days in Delhi?"
    answer: "Skip Akshardham Temple (it takes half a day), the National Museum (unless you're deeply into Indian art), and any day trip outside the city. Focus your time on Old Delhi and the central monument belt from Humayun's Tomb to India Gate."

**Two days in Delhi is enough to hit the major highlights, but not enough to explore the city properly.** You'll cover the big-name monuments, get a taste of Old Delhi's street food, and see enough to understand why this city has been rebuilt seven times. But the deeper neighbourhood experiences, the long lunches, and the side streets take longer.

## What You Can Realistically Cover in 2 Days

With two full days and an early start, here's what's achievable:

### Day 1: Old Delhi and Central Delhi

Start at **Red Fort** (Lal Qila) right when it opens at 9:30 AM. Ticket price is ₹35 ($0.40) for Indian nationals, ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign visitors. Spend about 90 minutes here. Walk from the fort's Lahori Gate straight into the chaos of **Chandni Chowk**, Delhi's oldest and most intense market street.

Head down the narrow lanes towards **Jama Masjid**, India's largest mosque. Entry is free, but there's a ₹300 ($3.60) camera fee. The view from the southern minaret is worth the ₹100 ($1.20) climb.

Grab lunch at **Karim's** near the mosque's Gate 1 — their mutton burra kebab has been the same recipe since 1913. A full meal runs about ₹400-600 ($5-7) per person.

In the afternoon, take the metro from Chandni Chowk station (Yellow Line) to **Humayun's Tomb**. Get off at JLN Stadium and take an auto for ₹30-40. This 16th-century tomb is the prototype for the Taj Mahal, and honestly, some people prefer it. Entry is ₹550 ($6.50) for foreigners. Budget 60-90 minutes.

End the day at **India Gate** and Kartavya Path (the old Rajpath) for sunset. The lawns fill up with families eating ice cream and flying kites — it's one of Delhi's best people-watching spots.

### Day 2: New Delhi Monuments and South Delhi

Start at **Qutub Minar** in Mehrauli. The 12th-century tower complex opens at sunrise, and going early beats both crowds and heat. Entry is ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign nationals. The iron pillar in the courtyard hasn't rusted in 1,600 years — metallurgists still argue about why.

From Qutub Minar, head to **Lodhi Gardens** for a walk among 15th-century tombs scattered across manicured lawns. Free entry, and it's one of the few green spaces in central Delhi where you can actually breathe.

Have lunch in **Khan Market** — try Big Chill for pasta or Perch for coffee and European food. Expect ₹800-1,200 ($10-15) per person at sit-down restaurants.

Spend the afternoon at the **National Gallery of Modern Art** near India Gate or explore **Connaught Place**, Delhi's colonial-era commercial centre. The white colonnaded buildings form a perfect circle, and the inner ring has bookshops, restaurants, and the original Wenger's bakery dating to 1926.

For your final dinner, **Indian Accent** in The Lodhi hotel is India's most celebrated contemporary restaurant if you want to splurge (₹5,000-8,000 / $60-95 per person with drinks). For something more casual, head to **SodaBottleOpenerWala** in Khan Market for Parsi comfort food around ₹800 ($10).

## What You'll Miss With Only 2 Days

Two days doesn't leave room for a proper [food tour through Old Delhi's back lanes](/delhi/food-tours/), where the real eating happens in shops you'd never find on your own. You'll also miss **Hauz Khas Village** and its lakeside ruins, the Sufi shrine at **Nizamuddin Dargah** (go on a Thursday evening for qawwali music), and the street art in Lodhi Colony.

If you're deciding between [2 days and 3 days](/delhi/how-to-spend-3-days-in-delhi/), that third day transforms the trip from a monument checklist into something more personal.

## Tips for Making 2 Days Work

**Use the Delhi Metro.** It's clean, cheap (₹10-60 per ride), and runs every 3-5 minutes on major lines. Traffic can eat two hours of your day otherwise. Get a tourist card at any metro station for unlimited rides — ₹200 ($2.40) for a 3-day pass.

**Start early.** Monuments open at sunrise or 9:30 AM. Morning light is better for photos, crowds are thinner, and in warmer months, you'll melt by noon.

**Don't try to do everything.** Rushing through eight sites in a day means you experience none of them. Pick five things per day maximum and let yourself wander between them.

**Book an Old Delhi walking tour for Day 1.** A knowledgeable guide through the Chandni Chowk lanes will show you things you'd walk right past — printing presses, spice warehouses, 400-year-old havelis behind market stalls.

## Can I See Delhi's Main Sights in 2 Days?

Yes. In two days you can visit Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, India Gate, and Connaught Place. You'll need to start early each morning and use the metro to avoid traffic. It's tight but doable if you prioritise.

## Should I Extend My Delhi Trip to 3 Days?

If your schedule allows it, absolutely. A third day lets you explore South Delhi neighbourhoods like Hauz Khas and Lodhi Colony, take a food tour through Old Delhi's lanes, or do a day trip to Agra. Two days covers monuments; three days lets you actually feel the city.

## What Should I Skip if I Only Have 2 Days in Delhi?

Skip Akshardham Temple (it takes half a day), the National Museum (unless you're deeply into Indian art), and any day trip outside the city. Focus your time on Old Delhi and the central monument belt from Humayun's Tomb to India Gate.
