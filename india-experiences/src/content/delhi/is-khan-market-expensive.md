  - question: "Is Khan Market expensive to shop at?"
    answer: "Yes, Khan Market is the most expensive retail area in India and has ranked among the costliest high streets globally. Rents here rival parts of London and Tokyo. A coffee costs ₹300-500 ($3.60-6), a casual lunch runs ₹800-1,500 ($9.60-18), and clothing starts at ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60). That said, browsing is free, and the independent bookshops and bakeries make it worth the trip."
  - question: "What is Khan Market known for?"
    answer: "Khan Market is known for its independent bookshops (Bahrisons, Full Circle, Faqir Chand), upscale cafes (Perch, Big Chill), boutique clothing stores (Anokhi, Good Earth, Nicobar), organic grocery shops, and a generally polished atmosphere. It's where South Delhi's affluent residents shop and eat, and it's been a landmark since the 1950s."
  - question: "Is Khan Market worth visiting as a tourist?"
    answer: "Yes, even if you don't buy much. The bookshops alone are excellent — Bahrisons has been operating since 1953 and stocks a strong India section. The food options are varied and reliably good. And the market itself is compact enough to cover in 1-2 hours. It's a good pairing with nearby Lodhi Gardens or Humayun's Tomb."

**Khan Market is the most expensive retail area in India — its per-square-foot rents have ranked among the top 25 high streets in the world.** But "expensive" is relative, and a visit here costs less than you might think if you know where to spend.

## What Makes It So Expensive

Khan Market's rents are driven by location (central Delhi, minutes from embassies and the Prime Minister's residence), limited supply (the horseshoe-shaped market has a fixed number of shops), and consistently high demand from premium brands.

A 500-square-foot shop here pays ₹5-8 lakh ($6,000-9,600) per month in rent. That cost gets passed to customers, which is why a flat white at **Perch** costs ₹350 ($4.20) and a cotton kurta at **Anokhi** starts at ₹2,500 ($30).

But here's the thing — those prices are still lower than equivalent shops in London, New York, or Tokyo. Khan Market is expensive by Indian standards, not by international ones.

## What Things Actually Cost

Here's a realistic price breakdown for a visit:

### Coffee and Cafes

- **Perch Coffee House** — flat white ₹300 ($3.60), cold brew ₹350 ($4.20). One of Delhi's best specialty coffee spots. Rooftop seating.
- **Big Chill Cakery** — pastries ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80), milkshakes ₹350 ($4.20). Their red velvet cake is famous citywide.
- **Cafe Turtle** — above Full Circle bookshop. Coffee ₹200-300 ($2.40-3.60), sandwiches ₹300-500 ($3.60-6). Quiet, bookish atmosphere.

For more recommendations, see our guide to [Delhi's best cafes](/delhi/best-cafes-in-delhi/).

### Lunch and Dinner

- **Big Chill** — Italian and Continental. Pasta ₹500-700 ($6-8.40), pizza ₹600-900 ($7-11). The Khan Market branch is always full — go before 12:30 PM or after 2:30 PM.
- **Town Hall** — modern Indian. Mains ₹600-900 ($7-11). Strong cocktail menu.
- **Amici** — Italian. Pizza ₹500-800 ($6-9.60). Casual and reliable.
- **Khan Chacha** — the exception to Khan Market pricing. Rolls and kebabs from ₹150-300 ($1.80-3.60). Chicken seekh rolls are the move.

A casual lunch for one runs ₹800-1,500 ($9.60-18). A proper dinner with drinks is ₹2,000-3,500 ($24-42).

### Shopping

- **Bahrisons Booksellers** — books ₹300-1,000 ($3.60-12). Operating since 1953. Their India and South Asia section is outstanding.
- **Full Circle** — another excellent bookshop with Cafe Turtle upstairs.
- **Faqir Chand & Sons** — more books. Three great bookshops in one small market is remarkable.
- **Anokhi** — block-printed cotton clothing. Kurtas ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60), scarves ₹800-2,000 ($9.60-24).
- **Good Earth** — luxury Indian homeware and clothing. Candles ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36), clothing ₹5,000+ ($60+). Beautiful but pricey.
- **Nicobar** — contemporary Indian design. Clothing, bags, homeware. Mid-to-high range.
- **Fabindia** — Indian cotton, silk, and ethnic wear at more moderate prices. Kurtas from ₹1,500-3,000 ($18-36).

### The Free Stuff

Browsing costs nothing, and Khan Market is genuinely pleasant to walk around. The architecture is mid-century with some older character, the lanes behind the main curve hide smaller shops and tailors, and the people-watching is excellent — diplomats, journalists, professors, and young professionals all use this as their local market.

## Getting There

Take the **Violet Line** metro to **Khan Market station**. The market entrance is a 2-minute walk from Exit 1. By Uber, search for Khan Market — there's a drop-off zone on Subramaniam Bharti Marg.

**Hours**: Most shops open 10:30 AM to 8:00 PM, Monday to Saturday. Restaurants keep later hours. The market is closed on Sundays, though some restaurants open anyway.

## What to Pair It With

Khan Market sits between two of Delhi's top attractions:

- **Lodhi Gardens** is a 10-minute walk south — free entry, 15th-century tombs, beautiful walking paths
- **Humayun's Tomb** is a 15-minute drive east — the Mughal monument that inspired the Taj Mahal

A good half-day: Humayun's Tomb in the morning, Lodhi Gardens for a walk, then lunch and bookshop browsing at Khan Market. See our guide to [things to do in South Delhi](/delhi/things-to-do-in-south-delhi/) for more ideas.

## Khan Market vs. Other Delhi Markets

If you're choosing where to spend your shopping time:

- **Khan Market vs. Sarojini Nagar**: Completely different worlds. Sarojini is for bargain clothing, Khan Market is for bookshops, cafes, and boutique browsing. Khan Market costs 5-10x more for comparable items.
- **Khan Market vs. Connaught Place**: CP is bigger, more chaotic, and has more mainstream brands. Khan Market is compact, curated, and more pleasant to walk around.
- **Khan Market vs. Hauz Khas Village**: Hauz Khas has more indie designer boutiques and a younger vibe. Khan Market is more established and better for food and books.
