faq:
  - question: "Was Delhi the capital of ancient India?"
    answer: "Delhi was one of several important power centres in ancient India, but not always the capital. It gained prominence under the Delhi Sultanate from 1206 AD. The Mughals made it their capital intermittently, and the British moved India's colonial capital here from Calcutta in 1911. Before the Sultanate, Delhi was significant but not dominant — cities like Pataliputra, Ujjain, and Kanauj held more power at various points."
  - question: "What is the oldest structure still standing in Delhi?"
    answer: "The iron pillar at the Qutub Minar complex dates to the 4th century AD (Gupta period) and is Delhi's oldest surviving metal structure. The oldest standing building is debated, but the Suraj Kund reservoir near Faridabad (technically in Haryana, on Delhi's border) dates to the 10th century. Within Delhi proper, the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque (1192) and Qutub Minar (1192-1220) are among the oldest intact structures."
  - question: "How many times has Delhi been destroyed and rebuilt?"
    answer: "At least seven times, corresponding to the seven historic cities of Delhi. Each successive dynasty — Tomars, Chauhans, Sultanate rulers, Mughals, British — built a new city rather than rebuilding the old one. The most dramatic destruction came from Timur's invasion in 1398, which devastated the city so completely that it took decades to recover. Nadir Shah's sack of Delhi in 1739 was similarly devastating."

**Delhi has been continuously inhabited since at least the 6th century BC, making the city roughly 2,500 years old.** Archaeological evidence at Purana Qila (Old Fort) near Pragati Maidan suggests this area may be the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas described in the Mahabharata.

## The Deep History

Excavations at Purana Qila in the 1950s and 1970s uncovered Painted Grey Ware pottery dating to around 1000 BC, which matches the time period associated with the Mahabharata. Whether or not you accept the Indraprastha legend, the archaeological record confirms that people have lived on this stretch of the Yamuna River for at least three millennia.

Delhi's strategic location explains its longevity. It sits at the western end of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where the Aravalli Hills force a natural bottleneck for armies, trade caravans, and migration routes moving between Central Asia and the Indian heartland. Every power that wanted to control North India eventually came to Delhi.

## Seven Cities, Ten Centuries

The history of Delhi is usually told through its [seven historic cities](/delhi/what-are-the-7-cities-of-delhi/), each built by a different dynasty in a different part of what is now the modern National Capital Territory:

1. **Lal Kot / Qila Rai Pithora** (1060-1180s) — Built by the Tomar and Chauhan Rajputs in what is now Mehrauli. The Qutub Minar complex sits on this site.

2. **Siri** (1303) — Alauddin Khalji built this fortified city about 5 km north of Mehrauli. Fragments of the walls survive near Siri Fort Auditorium and Panchsheel Park.

3. **Tughlaqabad** (1321) — A massive, short-lived fortress city built by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq on a rocky outcrop near Faridabad. The ruins are impressive but isolated.

4. **Jahanpanah** (1326-1327) — Muhammad bin Tughlaq connected Siri and Lal Kot with a new walled enclosure. Bijay Mandal, his palace, still stands in a residential neighbourhood near Panchsheel Park.

5. **Firozabad** (1354) — Firoz Shah Tughlaq built along the Yamuna, centred on what is now Feroz Shah Kotla near ITO. The Ashokan pillar he transported from Punjab still stands on the ruins.

6. **Dinpanah / Shergarh** (1533-1545) — Humayun and Sher Shah Suri fought over this site, which is today's Purana Qila. The oldest archaeological layers of Delhi lie beneath this fort.

7. **Shahjahanabad** (1638) — Shah Jahan's walled city is today's Old Delhi, centred on Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and Chandni Chowk. This is the only historic city that functions as a living, densely inhabited urban centre.

## Modern Delhi: 1911 Onward

The city you see in central Delhi — the wide avenues, the circular Connaught Place, Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate — was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker after the colonial government moved India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911. New Delhi was formally inaugurated in 1931.

After Indian independence in 1947, Delhi's population exploded. Partition refugees from what became Pakistan flooded the city, establishing new colonies and reshaping entire neighbourhoods. Lajpat Nagar, Rajouri Garden, and large parts of South Delhi were built to house this influx. The city went from about 700,000 people in 1941 to over 30 million in the metropolitan area today.

## Experiencing Delhi's Age

The best way to feel Delhi's layered history is to visit sites from different eras in sequence. Start at the Qutub Minar complex in Mehrauli (12th century), then drive to Humayun's Tomb (16th century), continue to Red Fort and Shahjahanabad (17th century), and end at Lutyens' Delhi around India Gate (20th century). In one day, you'll cross 800 years of construction.

The [heritage walks](/delhi/heritage-walks/) run by INTACH and Delhi Heritage Walks are particularly good at connecting these timelines. A Mehrauli walk will take you from Lal Kot through Sultanate ruins to Mughal-era structures, all within a 2 km radius.

For a count of what survives, Delhi has [174 ASI-protected monuments](/delhi/how-many-heritage-sites-are-in-delhi/) and hundreds more unprotected structures — making it one of the most archaeologically dense cities on earth.

## Was Delhi the Capital of Ancient India?

Delhi was one of several important power centres in ancient India, but not always the capital. It gained prominence under the Delhi Sultanate from 1206 AD. The Mughals made it their capital intermittently, and the British moved India's colonial capital here from Calcutta in 1911. Before the Sultanate, Delhi was significant but not dominant — cities like Pataliputra, Ujjain, and Kanauj held more power at various points.

## What Is the Oldest Structure Still Standing in Delhi?

The iron pillar at the Qutub Minar complex dates to the 4th century AD (Gupta period) and is Delhi's oldest surviving metal structure. The oldest standing building is debated, but the Suraj Kund reservoir near Faridabad (technically in Haryana, on Delhi's border) dates to the 10th century. Within Delhi proper, the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque (1192) and Qutub Minar (1192-1220) are among the oldest intact structures.

## How Many Times Has Delhi Been Destroyed and Rebuilt?

At least seven times, corresponding to the seven historic cities of Delhi. Each successive dynasty — Tomars, Chauhans, Sultanate rulers, Mughals, British — built a new city rather than rebuilding the old one. The most dramatic destruction came from Timur's invasion in 1398, which devastated the city so completely that it took decades to recover. Nadir Shah's sack of Delhi in 1739 was similarly devastating.
