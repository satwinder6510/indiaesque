    answer: "Moti Mahal in Daryaganj (Netaji Subhash Marg) is the original, at ₹350-450 per plate. Daryaganj restaurant in Connaught Place and Khan Market, run by a descendant of the original family, also claims the heritage. For the best-tasting versions today, try Gulati in Pandara Road (₹550-700), Moti Mahal Delux in Lajpat Nagar, and Rajinder Da Dhaba in Safdarjung Enclave for a no-frills version at ₹250-350."
  - question: "What makes Delhi butter chicken different from other versions?"
    answer: "Authentic Delhi butter chicken uses tandoori chicken — not raw chicken — simmered in a gravy of tomatoes, butter, cream, and a restrained spice blend (mainly garam masala, kasuri methi, and ginger). The gravy should be smooth, slightly sweet from the tomatoes, and rich without being heavy. Versions outside Delhi often add too many spices, skip the tandoori step, or use raw chicken, which changes the flavour fundamentally."

**Butter chicken was invented in Delhi in 1947 by Kundan Lal Gujral at Moti Mahal restaurant in Daryaganj — he simmered leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato, butter, and cream gravy, and accidentally created one of the most popular Indian dishes on the planet.** The dish has since spread to every Indian restaurant worldwide, but Delhi remains the best place to eat the original version.

## The Origin Story

Before Partition in 1947, Kundan Lal Gujral ran a restaurant called Moti Mahal in Peshawar (now in Pakistan). When the subcontinent was divided and millions of people displaced, Gujral moved to Delhi and re-established Moti Mahal on **Netaji Subhash Marg in Daryaganj**, near the old walled city.

The restaurant was already famous for tandoori chicken — whole chicken marinated in yoghurt and spices, then cooked in a clay tandoor oven at extreme heat. The problem was leftover tandoori chicken. It dried out quickly and couldn't be served the next day as-is.

Gujral's solution: he took the leftover pieces, simmered them in a gravy made from tomatoes, butter, and cream, and seasoned it with a light spice blend. The result was tender, smoky tandoori chicken in a rich, smooth, mildly spiced orange-red sauce. Customers went wild for it.

The dish spread through Delhi, then across India, then to the UK (via the British-Indian restaurant boom of the 1960s and 70s), and eventually worldwide. Today, butter chicken is arguably the most ordered Indian dish outside of India.

## What Makes It Authentic

Delhi-style butter chicken has specific characteristics that separate it from the versions you'll find in restaurants abroad:

**The chicken is tandoori first.** This is non-negotiable. The chicken is marinated in yoghurt, red chilli, and spices, then cooked in a tandoor until charred at the edges. It's pulled out, then added to the gravy. Restaurants that skip this step and use raw chicken in the sauce are making a different dish.

**The gravy is tomato-forward.** The base is slow-cooked tomatoes blended smooth, with generous butter and a finish of cream. The colour should be a warm orange-red, not bright red (that means too much food colouring) or pale yellow (not enough tomato).

**The spicing is restrained.** Authentic butter chicken uses garam masala, dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), ginger, and a touch of sugar to balance the tomato acidity. It should not taste like a spice bomb — the point is the interplay between smoky chicken, buttery tomato, and cream.

**The texture is smooth.** No chunks of onion or tomato in the gravy. It's blended until velvety.

## Where to Eat Butter Chicken in Delhi

### Moti Mahal — Daryaganj (The Original)

**Address:** 3704, Netaji Subhash Marg, Daryaganj
**Cost:** ₹350-450 ($4-5.50) per plate
**Metro:** Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line), then auto or walk (about 15 minutes south)

This is where it started. The restaurant still operates at its original location, though it's changed hands and expanded into a chain. The butter chicken here is decent — not necessarily the best in the city anymore, but eating it at the birthplace is meaningful. The **dal makhani** is also excellent, and Moti Mahal claims to have invented that dish too.

### Daryaganj — Connaught Place and Khan Market

Run by Amit Bagga, who is a descendant of the original Moti Mahal founders, this restaurant explicitly markets itself as serving the original butter chicken recipe. The family connection is documented, though Moti Mahal disputes the claim — the two went to court over it in 2023.

**Cost:** ₹450-600 ($5.50-7) per plate. The butter chicken here is well-made, creamy, and follows the traditional method.

### Gulati — Pandara Road

Many Delhi food writers consider Gulati's butter chicken the best-tasting version in the city right now. Pandara Road is a strip of restaurants near India Gate, and Gulati has been the anchor since the 1950s. The gravy is rich, the chicken is properly tandoori, and the portion sizes are generous.

**Cost:** ₹550-700 ($6.50-8.50) per plate. **Gets crowded** after 8 PM; go for a late lunch.

### Rajinder Da Dhaba — Safdarjung Enclave

A no-frills open-air dhaba (roadside eatery) in South Delhi that serves butter chicken to an evening crowd of locals. No tablecloths, plastic chairs, and the food arrives fast. The butter chicken is smoky and slightly less creamy than the fine-dining versions, which many people prefer.

**Cost:** ₹250-350 ($3-4) per plate. **Open:** Evenings only, roughly 6 PM to midnight.

### Havemore — Pandara Road

Another Pandara Road veteran, right next to Gulati. Their butter chicken is slightly spicier and less sweet than Gulati's version. Good alternative if Gulati has a wait.

**Cost:** ₹500-650 ($6-8) per plate.

## Butter Chicken vs Tikka Masala

Tourists often ask whether butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are the same dish. They're related but distinct. Butter chicken uses tandoori chicken (bone-in, whole pieces) in a butter-and-cream tomato sauce. Tikka masala, developed in the UK, typically uses boneless chicken tikka in a sauce that's often spicier, sometimes includes coconut or yoghurt, and varies widely from restaurant to restaurant. The makhani sauce in butter chicken is more standardised — there's a recognisable template.

## Practical Tips

**Order naan, not rice.** Butter chicken sauce is meant to be scooped with bread. A garlic naan or plain butter naan is the classic pairing.

**Ask for bone-in.** Many restaurants default to boneless chicken, especially for foreign visitors. The bone-in version has more flavour because the bones release gelatin into the sauce during cooking.

**Don't judge by colour alone.** Some restaurants add food colouring to make the sauce unnaturally orange. The authentic colour is a muted reddish-orange, not neon.
