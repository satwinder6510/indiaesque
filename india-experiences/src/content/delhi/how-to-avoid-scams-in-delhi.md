  - question: "What are the most common scams in Delhi?"
    answer: "The top scams targeting tourists in Delhi are: the fake tourist office near New Delhi Railway Station that sells overpriced tours, taxi and auto drivers claiming your hotel is closed or burned down to take you to a commission-paying hotel, the gem or carpet shop scam where someone befriends you and leads you to a store, and unsolicited 'guides' at monuments who demand payment. All are avoidable by ignoring unsolicited help and booking through verified apps."
  - question: "How do I avoid taxi scams at Delhi airport?"
    answer: "Use only the official Delhi Airport prepaid taxi counter inside the terminal building — it's run by Delhi Traffic Police and gives you a fixed-rate slip. Alternatively, book an Uber or Ola from the app. Never accept rides from drivers who approach you in the arrivals hall. The prepaid counter is past the exit gates on the left side."
  - question: "Is the tourist office near New Delhi station real?"
    answer: "No. The offices near Gate 1 and Gate 2 of New Delhi Railway Station with signs saying 'Government Tourist Office' or 'Official Tourism Bureau' are private travel agencies. They sell overpriced packages and fake train tickets. The real Government of India Tourist Office is at 88 Janpath, near Connaught Place — a separate building entirely, not at the station."

**The most common Delhi scams target tourists at three specific places: New Delhi Railway Station, the airport exit, and around major monuments like Red Fort and India Gate.** All of them rely on the same trick — someone approaches you with unsolicited help, and the help comes with a hidden cost. The fix is simple: ignore anyone who approaches you first.

Delhi has millions of honest, helpful people. But the tourist circuit has a well-rehearsed set of cons that catch first-time visitors off guard. Here's every major one and how to sidestep it.

## The Fake Tourist Office

This is Delhi's most notorious scam and has been running for decades. When you arrive at **New Delhi Railway Station** (especially Gate 1 or Gate 2), you'll see signs for "Government Tourist Office," "Official Tourism Bureau," or "Indian Railways Tourist Counter." These are **not government offices** — they're private travel agencies that pay rent for prime locations near the station.

Inside, a convincing operator will tell you that your train is cancelled, your hotel doesn't exist, or that they can get you a better deal on Rajasthan tours. They'll sell you overpriced packages, fake train tickets, or redirect you to commission-paying hotels.

**How to avoid it:** The real Government of India Tourist Office is at **88 Janpath**, near Connaught Place — it's a standalone building, not inside or near the railway station. For train bookings, use the IRCTC website or app. If you need help at the station, find the official Railway enquiry counter (inside the station building, past the metal detectors).

## The "Your Hotel Is Closed" Trick

You've just landed or arrived by train. You get in a taxi or auto rickshaw and tell the driver your hotel name. Somewhere along the route, the driver tells you: "That hotel is closed," "It burned down last week," "There's a strike in that area," or "I know a better hotel."

He then drives you to a hotel that pays him ₹500-1,000 commission per guest. You end up in an overpriced room while your actual booking goes unused.

**How to avoid it:** Book Uber or Ola through the app — drivers follow the GPS route and have no incentive to divert you. If you're in a taxi, call your hotel before you leave the airport to confirm your booking and get their exact address. If a driver claims your hotel is closed, insist on going there anyway. Read our guide on [getting around Delhi](/delhi/how-to-get-around-delhi/) for more on choosing the right transport.

## The Gem and Carpet Shop Scam

A friendly English-speaking man strikes up a conversation — maybe near India Gate, Connaught Place, or your hotel. After some pleasant chat, he invites you to visit his "uncle's shop" or says he can get you a special price on jewellery, carpets, or pashmina shawls. The shop sells you overpriced items, sometimes with a story about how you can resell them in your country for profit.

Variations include someone offering to take you to a "government emporium" (it's not government-run) or a spice shop where prices are 10x market rate.

**How to avoid it:** If someone approaches you on the street and the conversation steers toward shopping, politely decline and walk away. Genuine friendliness doesn't come with a destination attached. For real government emporiums, visit the **Central Cottage Industries Emporium** on Jawahar Vyapar Bhawan, Janpath — that one is actually government-run.

## Unsolicited Guides at Monuments

At **Red Fort**, **Humayun's Tomb**, **Qutub Minar**, and **Jama Masjid**, people will attach themselves to you and start giving a "free tour." After 20 minutes, they demand ₹500-1,000 as payment. At Jama Masjid specifically, someone may insist you need to pay them to enter or that shoes must be stored at their specific stall for a fee.

**How to avoid it:** Say "no, thank you" firmly and keep walking. Jama Masjid entry is free (there's a ₹300 camera fee but no entry fee). You can leave your shoes at the entrance yourself — no one needs to hold them for you. If you want a real guide, book one through your hotel or use a verified platform. For self-guided options, see our [Delhi safety tips](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/).

## Rickshaw Overcharging

Auto rickshaw drivers near tourist spots quote ₹300-500 for rides that should cost ₹50-100. Cycle rickshaw drivers in Old Delhi agree on ₹50 and then demand ₹500 when you arrive.

**How to avoid it:** Use **Uber Auto or Ola Auto** for fixed app-based pricing. If hailing on the street, agree on the exact fare before sitting down — not "we'll see" or "you pay what you want." Walk 200 metres from any monument before flagging a rickshaw. Read more in our guide on [things to avoid in Delhi](/delhi/what-should-i-avoid-in-delhi/).

## The Ear Cleaner and Shoe Polisher

Someone on the street points at your ear and says you have an infection, or crouches down and starts polishing your shoe before you can react. They then demand ₹200-500 for the "service."

**How to avoid it:** Don't stop. Keep walking and say no. This one works on hesitation — the faster you move past, the quicker they give up.

## General Rules

1. **Ignore anyone who approaches you first** with help, directions, or conversation near tourist areas.
2. **Book everything through apps or your hotel.** Taxis, tours, restaurant reservations — all safer through verified channels.
3. **Know the actual price of things.** Metro rides cost ₹10-60. An auto ride across central Delhi shouldn't be more than ₹100-150. A basic lunch is ₹200-400.
4. **Never hand over your passport** to anyone except hotel reception (for check-in) and official government counters.
5. **Trust is earned, not offered.** The more eager someone is to help, the more likely there's a commission involved.
