**Delhi's best street food includes golgappe, aloo tikki, chole bhature, dahi bhalle, ram ladoo, chole kulche, and kebab rolls — all eaten standing up at stalls that have been perfecting single dishes for decades.** No other Indian city has this depth of street food, and most of the best places don't have a sign out front.

Here are 15 dishes you need to eat, with exactly where to find each one.

## 1. Golgappe (Pani Puri)

Hollow crispy shells filled with spiced potato, chickpeas, and tangy mint-tamarind water. You eat them one at a time, whole, as the vendor hands them over. **Bhimsain's** in old Bengali Market (near Barakhamba Road metro) has been doing this since the 1950s. ₹40-60 ($0.50-0.70) per plate of 6.

## 2. Aloo Tikki

Crispy mashed potato patties topped with chickpea curry, yoghurt, and three types of chutney. The best version in the city is at **Kashi Chaat Bhandar** in Amar Colony market. ₹60-80 ($0.70-1) per plate.

## 3. Dahi Bhalle

Soft lentil dumplings soaked in whipped yoghurt, topped with tamarind and mint chutney plus roasted cumin. **Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala** in Chandni Chowk has served this for over 80 years. ₹80 ($1) per plate. The texture should be pillowy — if the bhalle are dense, you're at the wrong stall.

## 4. Chole Bhature

Delhi's heavyweight breakfast. Spiced chickpea curry with deep-fried puffed bread. **Sita Ram Diwan Chand** in Paharganj (Chuna Mandi, near New Delhi railway station) is the classic choice at ₹80 ($1). **Baba Nagpal Corner** in Lajpat Nagar runs a close second.

## 5. Chole Kulche

The lighter cousin of chole bhature — same chickpea curry but with soft leavened bread instead of fried. Find it at pushcart vendors across central Delhi, especially around **Connaught Place** and **Kamla Nagar** near Delhi University. ₹40-60 ($0.50-0.70).

## 6. Ram Ladoo

Deep-fried moong dal fritters served with shredded radish and green chutney. These bright yellow balls appear on carts outside every metro station and market in Delhi. ₹30-40 ($0.35-0.50) for a generous plate. They're best straight from the kadhai.

## 7. Paranthe (Stuffed Parathas)

Stuffed flatbreads fried on a griddle, served with pickle and potato curry. [Paranthe Wali Gali](/delhi/what-is-paranthe-wali-gali/) in Chandni Chowk is the legendary spot with fillings from aloo to rabri. ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.20) per paratha plate.

## 8. Kebab Rolls

Seekh kebab or chicken tikka wrapped in a paratha with onion, chutney, and lemon. **Wah! Kebab Roll** stalls in Khan Market and **Kathi Roll** vendors across CP do solid versions. ₹80-150 ($1-1.80) per roll.

## 9. Chaat Papdi

Flat crispy wafers topped with potato, chickpeas, yoghurt, and chutneys. It's the entry-level chaat — less intense than golgappe but equally addictive. Available at virtually every chaat stall; the [Old Delhi food lanes](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/) have the most authentic versions.

## 10. Momos

Not originally a Delhi dish, but the city has adopted Tibetan steamed dumplings completely. Chicken or veg momos with fiery red chutney. **Dolma Aunty Momos** in Lajpat Nagar (the original pushcart, not the branded stores) charges ₹60-80 ($0.70-1) for a plate of 8. The Majnu ka Tilla Tibetan colony near Vidhan Sabha metro has the most authentic versions.

## 11. Kulfi Falooda

Dense frozen milk dessert (richer than ice cream) served with vermicelli noodles, rose syrup, and basil seeds. **Kuremal Mohan Lal Kulfi Wale** in Chawri Bazaar has been making kulfi since 1906. ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.20) per serving. The mango and paan flavours are outstanding.

## 12. Jalebis

Crispy fried batter spirals soaked in sugar syrup. **Old Famous Jalebi Wala** at the Dariba Kalan crossing in Chandni Chowk is the classic spot. ₹60-80 ($0.70-1) per plate. Eat them hot — cold jalebis are a different (worse) food.

## 13. Bedmi Puri with Aloo

Puffed bread stuffed with spiced lentil paste, served with potato curry. This is a classic Delhi breakfast, especially strong in **Karol Bagh** and **Old Delhi**. **Shyam Sweets** in Chandni Chowk does an excellent version. ₹50-70 ($0.60-0.85).

## 14. Raj Kachori

A giant crispy shell filled with yoghurt, chickpeas, potato, and chutneys — essentially a supersized golgappa that you eat with a spoon. Find good ones at **Haldiram's** in Chandni Chowk (the original outlet, not the chain version) for ₹80-120 ($1-1.50).

## 15. Fruit Cream

Chopped seasonal fruits mixed with fresh cream and a dusting of sugar. Sold from carts outside markets, especially in **Kamla Nagar** and **Sarojini Nagar**. ₹60-80 ($0.70-1). Simple and surprisingly good, especially in summer.

## How to Navigate Delhi's Street Food

The highest concentration of stalls is in Chandni Chowk. Take the Yellow Line metro to Chandni Chowk station, exit towards the main road, and start walking towards Fatehpuri Mosque. Nearly every lane branching off the main road has food worth stopping for.

For a structured introduction, a [guided food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) covers 8-12 tastings in 3-4 hours and takes you to stalls you'd never find alone.
