**Your best option depends entirely on budget: Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar for cheap fashion under ₹500, Select Citywalk and Khan Market for mid-range brands, and Hauz Khas Village for independent designer pieces.** Delhi covers every price point, and there's a specific market for each.

## Budget: Under ₹500 per Item

### Sarojini Nagar Market

This is Delhi's bargain capital for Western-style clothing. The open-air market sells export-surplus stock — overruns and rejected pieces from international brands that were manufactured in Indian factories. You'll find t-shirts for ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40), dresses for ₹200-500 ($2.40-6), jeans for ₹300-600 ($3.60-7), and jackets for ₹400-800 ($4.80-9.60).

The catch: you're digging through piles. Not everything here is wearable — check seams, zippers, and fabric quality before buying. Go on a weekday morning when the lanes are less packed.

**Getting there**: Pink Line metro to Sarojini Nagar station. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 AM to 9 PM. Closed Mondays.

Bargaining is mandatory. Start at 40-50% of the asking price.

### Lajpat Nagar Central Market

Where Delhi's middle class shops for Indian ethnic wear. Kurtas, salwar suits, lehengas, and sarees at prices well below mall rates. A cotton kurta runs ₹300-800 ($3.60-9.60), and you can find festive wear for ₹1,000-3,000 ($12-36).

The fabric shops here are also excellent — buy material and get it stitched by one of the market's many tailors. A custom-tailored kurta costs about ₹500-1,500 ($6-18) including fabric and stitching.

**Getting there**: Violet Line metro to Lajpat Nagar station. Open daily except Monday, 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM.

### Gandhi Nagar Market (East Delhi)

Delhi's largest wholesale garment market. Mostly Indian ethnic wear — kurtas, sarees, leggings, dupattas — at wholesale rates. Prices are rock-bottom, but the market is chaotic and far from tourist areas. Worth the trip only if you're buying in bulk or want the absolute lowest prices.

**Getting there**: Blue Line metro to Welcome station, then a short auto ride.

## Mid-Range: ₹1,000-5,000 per Item

### Select Citywalk, Saket

South Delhi's best shopping mall. International brands (Zara, H&M, Mango, Uniqlo), Indian designer labels (AND, Global Desi, W), and a solid food court. Prices are standard retail — no bargaining.

**Getting there**: Yellow Line metro to Saket station, then a short walk or shuttle.

### Khan Market

Delhi's most upscale open-air market has several clothing boutiques worth browsing. **Anokhi** sells block-printed cotton clothing. **Good Earth** has high-end Indian-contemporary fashion and homeware. Smaller boutiques in the back lanes carry independent labels.

Prices are higher here than almost anywhere else in Delhi. A cotton dress at Anokhi runs ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60). But the quality matches. Read more about [whether Khan Market is expensive](/delhi/is-khan-market-expensive/) and what makes it worth the visit.

**Getting there**: Violet Line metro to Khan Market station.

### South Extension (Part I & II)

Two connected market blocks with a mix of chain stores and independent boutiques. More affordable than Khan Market but more polished than Lajpat Nagar. Good for Indian designer wear in the ₹2,000-8,000 ($24-96) range. The bridal stores here are popular for wedding shopping.

**Getting there**: Violet Line metro to Lajpat Nagar station, then auto to South Ex.

## Designer and Independent Labels: ₹5,000+

### Hauz Khas Village

A cluster of small boutiques, design studios, and concept stores built around a 13th-century reservoir and madrasa complex. This is where Delhi's young designers set up shop — you'll find contemporary Indian clothing, hand-block-printed dresses, upcycled fashion, and limited-run pieces you won't see anywhere else.

Prices are higher than markets but lower than comparable Western indie brands — dresses from ₹3,000-10,000 ($36-120), handcrafted jewellery from ₹500-5,000 ($6-60).

Browse the shops, then grab coffee at one of the lane's many cafes. For more on the area, see our guide to [things to do in Hauz Khas](/delhi/things-to-do-in-hauz-khas/).

**Getting there**: Green Line metro to Hauz Khas station, then a 10-minute walk or short auto.

### Shahpur Jat

A smaller, less touristy version of Hauz Khas Village. This urban village has been colonised by fashion designers, stylists, and small ateliers. If you want custom-made clothing from young Indian designers, this is the neighbourhood. Expect to pay ₹5,000-25,000 ($60-300) for bespoke pieces.

**Getting there**: Near Hauz Khas, accessible by auto from Hauz Khas or Green Park metro.

### Meherchand Market and Santushti Shopping Complex

Two quiet, upscale enclaves near Lodhi Colony. Santushti (near Chanakya Puri) specialises in high-end Indian designer wear. Meherchand Market has boutiques carrying established names. Both are calm, uncrowded, and designed for serious shoppers.
