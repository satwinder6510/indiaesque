  - question: "What is a realistic daily budget for Delhi?"
    answer: "For a comfortable trip, budget ₹5,000-8,000 ($60-95) per day. That covers a private room in a decent hotel (₹2,500-4,000), meals at a mix of street stalls and restaurants (₹500-1,500), Uber rides and metro (₹200-500), and monument entry fees (₹550-1,650). Budget travellers can manage on ₹2,000-3,000 ($24-36) with hostel dorms and street food. Luxury travellers should plan for ₹15,000+ ($180+)."
  - question: "How much do monument entry fees cost in Delhi?"
    answer: "Foreign tourists pay ₹550 ($6.50) each for Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and Qutub Minar — the three big-ticket ASI sites. If you visit all three in one day, that's ₹1,650 ($20) in entry alone. Many other sites are free: Lodhi Gardens, India Gate, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, and the major mosques. Budget ₹1,000-2,000 ($12-24) per day for sightseeing fees if you're visiting paid monuments."
  - question: "Is it cheaper to use the Delhi Metro or Uber?"
    answer: "The Delhi Metro is significantly cheaper. A cross-city metro ride costs ₹20-60 ($0.25-0.72), while the same trip by Uber runs ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80). The metro is also faster during rush hours when roads are gridlocked. Get a 3-day tourist card for ₹200 ($2.40) for unlimited rides. Use Uber or Ola for last-mile connections from metro stations or late-night travel when the metro stops running at 11 PM."

**Plan for ₹2,000-3,000 ($24-36) per day on a tight budget, ₹5,000-10,000 ($60-120) for comfortable mid-range travel, or ₹15,000+ ($180+) for luxury.** The biggest variables are where you sleep and how many paid monuments you visit. Food and transport in Delhi are cheap at every level.

## Daily Budget Breakdown: Budget Tier (₹2,000-3,000/day)

This tier works if you're comfortable with dorm beds, eating mostly at street stalls, and using the metro.

| Category | Cost (₹) | Cost ($) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Hostel dorm bed | 500-800 | 6-10 |
| Breakfast (paratha + chai from street stall) | 50-80 | 0.60-1 |
| Lunch (thali at local restaurant) | 150-250 | 1.80-3 |
| Dinner (street food) | 100-200 | 1.20-2.40 |
| Metro rides (4-5 trips) | 80-150 | 1-1.80 |
| One monument entry (foreigner price) | 550 | 6.50 |
| Water + snacks | 50-100 | 0.60-1.20 |
| **Daily total** | **1,580-2,130** | **19-26** |

Add ₹500-800 for a second monument or an auto ride and you're in the ₹2,000-3,000 range. At this level, you eat well — a plate of chole bhature at Sita Ram Diwan Chand is ₹80, and it's among the best food in the city.

## Daily Budget Breakdown: Mid-Range Tier (₹5,000-10,000/day)

Private room, sit-down lunches, Uber when it's convenient, and no stress about entry fees.

| Category | Cost (₹) | Cost ($) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Hotel private room (3-star, CP/South Delhi) | 2,500-5,000 | 30-60 |
| Breakfast (hotel or cafe) | 200-400 | 2.40-4.80 |
| Lunch (restaurant in Khan Market/Hauz Khas) | 500-1,000 | 6-12 |
| Dinner (mid-range restaurant) | 600-1,200 | 7-14 |
| Uber/Ola rides (2-3 trips) | 300-600 | 3.60-7 |
| Metro rides (2-3 trips) | 40-100 | 0.50-1.20 |
| Monument entries (2-3 sites) | 1,100-1,650 | 13-20 |
| **Daily total** | **5,240-9,950** | **63-119** |

This is the sweet spot for most visitors. You can mix street food meals with proper restaurant dinners, take Uber when you don't feel like finding a metro station, and visit whatever interests you without watching the budget.

## Daily Budget Breakdown: Luxury Tier (₹15,000-30,000+/day)

Five-star hotels, a car with driver, fine dining, and private guides.

| Category | Cost (₹) | Cost ($) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 5-star hotel (The Imperial, The Lodhi) | 8,000-25,000 | 95-300 |
| Breakfast (hotel included or cafe) | 0-500 | 0-6 |
| Lunch (upscale restaurant) | 1,500-3,000 | 18-36 |
| Dinner (fine dining — Indian Accent, Bukhara) | 3,000-8,000 | 36-95 |
| Car with driver (full day) | 3,000-5,000 | 36-60 |
| Monument entries + guide | 2,000-3,000 | 24-36 |
| **Daily total** | **17,500-44,500** | **209-533** |

Even at the luxury tier, Delhi costs a fraction of comparable experiences in European or American cities. A meal at Indian Accent — regularly ranked among Asia's best restaurants — costs about what a mid-range dinner costs in London.

## Where the Money Actually Goes

### Accommodation: 40-60% of Budget

This is your biggest controllable expense. The gap between a ₹600 hostel dorm and a ₹4,000 hotel room is the difference between the budget and mid-range tier. Location matters too — South Delhi and CP [cost more than Karol Bagh or Paharganj](/delhi/where-should-i-stay-in-delhi/), but the comfort and safety difference is real.

### Food: 15-25% of Budget

Delhi is absurdly cheap for food. You could eat three street food meals a day for under ₹400 ($5). Even restaurant meals in popular areas like Khan Market rarely exceed ₹1,000 ($12) per person unless you're at a fine dining spot. Signing up for a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) early in your trip (₹1,500-2,500) pays for itself when you discover cheap stalls you'd never find alone.

### Transport: 5-15% of Budget

The Delhi Metro keeps this category tiny. A 3-day unlimited tourist card costs ₹200 ($2.40). Even with a few Uber rides mixed in, daily transport rarely exceeds ₹500 ($6). The exception is if you skip the metro entirely and Uber everywhere — that can add ₹1,000-1,500 per day. Read our [guide to getting around Delhi](/delhi/how-to-get-around-delhi/) for the most efficient approach.

### Sightseeing: 10-25% of Budget

The dual pricing system for foreigners at ASI monuments means sightseeing costs more than you'd expect. Three major monuments in a day cost ₹1,650 ($20). Balance paid sites with free ones — Lodhi Gardens, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, India Gate, and the Dilli Haat crafts market (₹30 entry) are all worth your time.

## Money-Saving Tips

**Get a metro tourist card immediately.** The 3-day unlimited card for ₹200 saves both money and the hassle of buying tokens each time.

**Eat where locals eat.** A neighbourhood restaurant in Lajpat Nagar charges half what the same dish costs in Khan Market. The food is often better too.

**Combine nearby sites.** Humayun's Tomb, Nizamuddin Dargah, and Lodhi Gardens are all within walking distance. Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and Chandni Chowk are a single morning. Planning by geography saves on transport.

**Skip bottled water at tourist sites.** Buy a 1-litre bottle at a regular shop for ₹20. The same bottle at Red Fort costs ₹50-80.

## What Is a Realistic Daily Budget for Delhi?

For a comfortable trip, budget ₹5,000-8,000 ($60-95) per day. That covers a private room in a decent hotel (₹2,500-4,000), meals at a mix of street stalls and restaurants (₹500-1,500), Uber rides and metro (₹200-500), and monument entry fees (₹550-1,650). Budget travellers can manage on ₹2,000-3,000 ($24-36) with hostel dorms and street food. Luxury travellers should plan for ₹15,000+ ($180+).

## How Much Do Monument Entry Fees Cost in Delhi?

Foreign tourists pay ₹550 ($6.50) each for Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and Qutub Minar — the three big-ticket ASI sites. If you visit all three in one day, that's ₹1,650 ($20) in entry alone. Many other sites are free: Lodhi Gardens, India Gate, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, and the major mosques. Budget ₹1,000-2,000 ($12-24) per day for sightseeing fees if you're visiting paid monuments.

## Is It Cheaper to Use the Delhi Metro or Uber?

The Delhi Metro is significantly cheaper. A cross-city metro ride costs ₹20-60 ($0.25-0.72), while the same trip by Uber runs ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80). The metro is also faster during rush hours when roads are gridlocked. Get a 3-day tourist card for ₹200 ($2.40) for unlimited rides. Use Uber or Ola for last-mile connections from metro stations or late-night travel when the metro stops running at 11 PM.
