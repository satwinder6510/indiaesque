  - question: "When is Delhi's air pollution worst?"
    answer: "November through January is the worst period, with daily AQI readings often between 300-500 (hazardous). The spike is caused by crop stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, Diwali fireworks in late October or November, cold weather that traps pollutants near the ground, and reduced wind. February and March improve significantly. April through September has moderate to good air quality."
  - question: "Should I wear a mask in Delhi?"
    answer: "If the AQI is above 200, yes — wear an N95 or KN95 mask outdoors. Regular cloth or surgical masks don't filter the fine PM2.5 particles that cause the real damage. You can buy N95 masks at any pharmacy in Delhi for ₹50-150 each. Below AQI 150, most healthy adults can manage without a mask for short outdoor periods."
  - question: "Is it safe to visit Delhi in winter despite the pollution?"
    answer: "It depends on your health. If you have asthma, COPD, or heart conditions, November-January is risky and you should consider visiting October or February-March instead. Healthy adults can manage a winter visit with precautions — wear an N95 mask on bad days, limit outdoor time when AQI exceeds 300, and run an air purifier in your hotel room. Many hotels now provide purifiers on request."

**Yes, Delhi has a serious air pollution problem, and it's worst from November through January when the Air Quality Index (AQI) regularly climbs above 300 — classified as hazardous.** If you're visiting during these months, check the AQI daily, carry an N95 mask, and plan your outdoor sightseeing for the morning hours when levels tend to be lower.

Delhi isn't polluted year-round, though. From March through September, air quality is moderate to good. October is generally fine. The crisis window is specifically late October (around Diwali) through late January, when a combination of crop burning, fireworks, cold temperatures, and stagnant air creates the grey haze that makes international headlines.

## Understanding Delhi's AQI

The AQI scale runs from 0 to 500:

| AQI Range | Category | What It Means for You |
|---|---|---|
| 0-50 | Good | No precautions needed |
| 51-100 | Moderate | Sensitive individuals may notice symptoms |
| 101-200 | Unhealthy for sensitive groups | Limit prolonged outdoor activity if you have asthma |
| 201-300 | Unhealthy | Wear N95 mask outdoors, limit outdoor time |
| 301-400 | Very unhealthy | Minimise all outdoor exposure |
| 401-500 | Hazardous | Stay indoors as much as possible |

**Where to check:** The IQAir app and website give real-time Delhi AQI readings from multiple monitoring stations. SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting) is the Indian government's monitoring system with local station data.

During peak pollution season, Delhi regularly hits 300-500. On the worst days — typically the week after Diwali and during dense winter fog in December-January — the AQI can pin at 500 for days.

## Why It Gets So Bad in Winter

**Crop stubble burning.** Farmers in Punjab and Haryana burn rice crop residue after harvest in October-November. The smoke drifts southeast into Delhi and the NCR region. This alone accounts for a massive spike in PM2.5 levels.

**Diwali fireworks.** Despite periodic bans, millions of firecrackers are set off during Diwali (October or November, depending on the year). AQI typically jumps 100-200 points overnight during Diwali. See our guide on [Diwali in Delhi](/delhi/diwali-in-delhi-what-to-expect/) for what to expect.

**Temperature inversion.** Cold winter air traps warm polluted air close to the ground. Without wind to disperse it, pollutants accumulate day after day. This meteorological effect is why even on days with no local pollution sources, AQI stays high.

**Vehicle emissions and construction dust.** Delhi has 12+ million registered vehicles and constant construction. These are year-round contributors, but their impact is amplified when cold, still air prevents dispersion.

## How To Protect Yourself

### Masks

Buy **N95 or KN95 masks** — regular cloth and surgical masks don't filter PM2.5 particles effectively. Available at pharmacies across Delhi for ₹50-150 ($0.60-1.80) each. Brands like 3M and Venus are reliable. Make sure the mask fits snugly around your nose and chin with no gaps.

Wear the mask when AQI is above 200 and you're spending extended time outdoors. Quick walks between a car and a building don't need one.

### Air Purifiers

Many mid-range and upscale hotels in Delhi now have air purifiers in rooms, especially during winter. Ask at check-in — if they don't have one in your room, request it. Some hotels with central HVAC systems filter the entire building's air.

If you're staying in a budget hotel without a purifier, keep windows closed and run the bathroom exhaust fan — it's better than nothing.

### Plan Your Day Around AQI

AQI tends to be **lower in the morning (8-11 AM)** and **higher in the evening and night**. Schedule outdoor sightseeing — monument visits, walks, markets — for the morning. Spend afternoons and evenings at indoor attractions: museums, restaurants, shopping malls.

The [weather in Delhi](/delhi/what-is-the-weather-like-in-delhi/) also affects pollution — rainy days wash pollutants out of the air, and windy days help disperse them.

### Indoor Activities for Bad Days

When AQI hits 400+, pivot to indoor plans:

- **National Museum** on Janpath
- **National Gallery of Modern Art** near India Gate
- **Shopping malls** like Select Citywalk in Saket
- **Cooking classes** (several operators run them in South Delhi homes)
- **Spa days** at your hotel

## When To Visit Instead

If pollution is a dealbreaker, plan your trip for these windows:

**October (early):** Weather is pleasant, pollution hasn't started, and Dussehra festivals are on. AQI typically 80-150.

**February-March:** Pollution has cleared significantly. AQI drops to 100-200 and falling. Weather is comfortable — cool mornings, warm afternoons. Holi falls in March.

**July-September (monsoon):** Rain clears the air dramatically. AQI can drop below 50. The downside is heat, humidity, and heavy rain that disrupts outdoor plans.
