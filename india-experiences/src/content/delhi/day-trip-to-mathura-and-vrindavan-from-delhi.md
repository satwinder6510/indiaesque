  - question: "How far is Mathura from Delhi?"
    answer: "Mathura is approximately 180 kilometres from Delhi, which takes 3-3.5 hours by road depending on traffic. The Taj Express train covers the distance in about 2.5 hours. Vrindavan is a further 15 kilometres from Mathura."
  - question: "What is the best time to visit Vrindavan?"
    answer: "October to March offers the most comfortable weather for visiting. Holi in March is the most spectacular time — Vrindavan's Holi celebrations last nearly a week and draw thousands of visitors. Janmashtami in August/September is another major event celebrating Krishna's birthday."
  - question: "Can you visit both Mathura and Vrindavan in one day?"
    answer: "Yes, but it requires an early start from Delhi. Leave by 6:00-6:30am, spend the morning in Mathura (Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple, Vishram Ghat), then drive to Vrindavan after lunch for Banke Bihari Temple and ISKCON. Return to Delhi by 7:00-8:00pm."

**Mathura and Vrindavan make one of the most rewarding day trips from Delhi — a 3-hour drive south to the birthplace of Lord Krishna and the town where he spent his childhood.** The twin cities sit on the banks of the Yamuna River and pack in hundreds of temples, colourful ghats, and some of the most intense religious energy you'll find anywhere in India.

This isn't a monuments-and-museums trip. Mathura and Vrindavan are living pilgrimage towns where devotion spills out of every lane. Expect chanting, temple bells, monkeys, and streets covered in flower petals. It's loud, chaotic, deeply atmospheric, and completely unlike anything in Delhi.

## Getting There From Delhi

### By Car

The most practical option for a day trip. The drive is approximately 180 kilometres via the Yamuna Expressway, taking 3-3.5 hours depending on Delhi traffic. Once you clear the city, the expressway is smooth and fast.

**Hiring a car with driver** costs ₹3,000-4,500 ($36-54) for a full-day return trip. Your driver will wait while you explore both towns. This is the best option because it lets you move between Mathura and Vrindavan (15 kilometres apart) without finding local transport.

Book through your Delhi hotel or use apps like Savaari or MakeMyTrip for pre-booked car hire. Agree on the price and itinerary before departure.

### By Train

The **Taj Express** departs New Delhi station early morning and reaches Mathura Junction in about 2.5 hours. Tickets cost ₹100-500 depending on class. The **Braj Express** and several Shatabdi trains also cover this route.

From Mathura Junction, auto-rickshaws to the main temple area cost ₹50-100. To reach Vrindavan from Mathura, shared autos run constantly for ₹30-50 per person.

The train is cheaper but less flexible for covering both towns in a single day. You'll spend time negotiating local transport between stops.

### By Bus

UP State Transport buses run from Delhi's Anand Vihar ISBT to Mathura every 30-60 minutes. Journey time is 3.5-4 hours. Fare is ₹200-350. Not the most comfortable option, but it works on a budget.

## What To See in Mathura

### Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple

The main attraction — the temple complex marks the exact spot where Lord Krishna is believed to have been born. The underground prison cell where his parents were held is the most visited section. Security is tight (no phones, bags, or shoes inside). Free entry. Open 5:00am-12:00pm and 4:00pm-9:00pm.

Allow 45-60 minutes for the visit including the security queue.

### Vishram Ghat

The main ghat on the Yamuna River, where Krishna is said to have rested after defeating the tyrant king Kansa. This is the heart of Mathura's spiritual life. Evening aarti (prayer ceremony) at sunset is worth timing your visit around — it happens daily at approximately 6:30-7:00pm.

The ghat is lined with smaller temples. A boat ride on the Yamuna costs ₹100-200 per person (20-30 minutes) and gives you views of the entire ghats.

### Dwarkadhish Temple

Built in 1814, this ornate temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna as the King of Dwarka. The architecture is elaborate — carved balconies, painted ceilings, and intricate stone work. Best visited in the morning when the light hits the facade. Open 6:30am-12:30pm and 4:00pm-9:30pm.

### Government Museum Mathura

One of India's best collections of Mathura School sculpture — Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu art dating from the 3rd century BC. The headless Kanishka statue and the standing Buddha are highlights. Entry ₹20 for Indians, ₹300 for foreigners. Closed Mondays.

## What To See in Vrindavan

### Banke Bihari Temple

The most famous temple in Vrindavan, dedicated to Krishna in his childhood form. The atmosphere inside is electric — devotees singing, swaying, and throwing flowers at the deity. The curtain in front of the idol opens and closes every few minutes (the priests believe the deity's gaze is too powerful for continuous viewing).

Expect crowds. Visit early morning (7:00-8:00am) for a less chaotic experience. Remove shoes well before the entrance. Free entry.

### ISKCON Temple (Sri Krishna Balaram Mandir)

Founded in 1975 by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, this marble temple is calmer and more organised than Vrindavan's older temples. Air-conditioned interior, well-maintained gardens, and a restaurant serving pure vegetarian food. Good for visitors who find the intensity of the old town temples overwhelming.

Open 4:30am-1:00pm and 4:30pm-8:30pm. Free entry.

### Prem Mandir

A relatively new temple (completed 2012) built entirely from white Italian marble. The exterior is covered with carved panels depicting scenes from Krishna's life. Spectacular when illuminated at night — the light show runs 7:30-8:30pm daily. Free entry.

### Nidhivan

A sacred grove where Krishna is believed to dance with the gopis (milkmaids) every night. The trees here grow in unusual twisted shapes. Locals will tell you no one can stay in the grove after dark and survive. Whether you believe the legends or not, the atmosphere is genuinely eerie. Open during daylight hours. Free entry.

## Food in Mathura and Vrindavan

Both towns are strictly vegetarian — you won't find meat, eggs, or alcohol anywhere. The local food is excellent:

- **Mathura ke pede** — the city's signature sweet, made from condensed milk and sugar. Buy from shops along the road to Krishna Janmabhoomi. ₹300-500 per kg.
- **Kachori and aloo sabzi** — fried bread with spiced potato curry, the standard breakfast. Available at stalls near every temple.
- **Lassi** — thick, creamy yoghurt drinks. Vrindavan's lassi shops serve it in clay cups.
- **Rabri** — sweetened condensed milk dessert, often served with jalebi.

The ISKCON temple restaurant in Vrindavan serves a clean, reliable thali (set meal) for ₹150-200.

## Visiting During Holi

Holi in Mathura and Vrindavan is unlike anywhere else in India. Celebrations span nearly a week, starting with Lathmar Holi in nearby Barsana (where women ceremonially beat men with sticks) and building toward the main day of colours.

If you're planning a [Holi trip from Delhi](/delhi/where-to-celebrate-holi-in-delhi/), Vrindavan is the epicentre. A few things to know:

- Wear white clothes you don't mind ruining
- Leave electronics in your hotel — colour powder gets into everything
- The celebrations are intense and physical — you will be covered head to toe
- Book transport well in advance — every car service in Delhi gets booked for Holi

## Practical Tips

**Start early.** Leave Delhi by 6:00-6:30am to beat traffic and maximise your time. The towns are best explored before the midday heat.

**Dress modestly.** Both towns are deeply religious. Cover shoulders and knees. Women should carry a scarf for temple visits.

**Carry cash.** Most temples, stalls, and auto-rickshaws in Mathura and Vrindavan don't accept cards. ₹1,000-2,000 in small notes is sufficient.

**Watch the monkeys.** Vrindavan's monkey population is bold and will grab food, sunglasses, and anything shiny. Keep belongings secured.

**Combine with Agra.** Mathura is only 60 kilometres from Agra. If you have two days, you could do Mathura-Vrindavan on day one and [Agra and the Taj Mahal](/delhi/can-you-do-a-day-trip-from-delhi-to-agra/) on day two. This makes a strong weekend trip from Delhi.
