  - question: "What clothes should I wear in Delhi?"
    answer: "It depends entirely on the season. October to February: layers — mornings and evenings are cold (5-15°C), but afternoons warm up. December-January specifically requires a proper jacket, scarf, and warm shoes. March to May: light cotton and linen, sunglasses, and a hat — temperatures hit 40-45°C. June to September: light, quick-dry fabrics for monsoon humidity and rain. Year-round, bring modest clothing that covers shoulders and knees for temple and mosque visits."
  - question: "Do I need to dress conservatively in Delhi?"
    answer: "For religious sites, yes — cover your shoulders and knees at temples, mosques, and gurudwaras. Jama Masjid and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib both require head coverings (scarves provided at gurudwaras, bring your own for mosques). On regular streets, Delhi is a modern city and you'll see everything from jeans to saris. That said, dressing modestly in less touristy areas reduces unwanted attention, especially for women. Carry a light scarf that doubles as a head covering and a shoulder wrap."
  - question: "Should I bring medicine to Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Pack loperamide (Imodium) for stomach issues, ORS sachets or electrolyte tablets, basic painkillers (paracetamol/ibuprofen), antihistamines for allergies, and any prescription medications you take regularly. A course of antibiotics (azithromycin or ciprofloxacin) from your travel doctor is smart for severe traveller's diarrhea. Delhi pharmacies stock most over-the-counter medicines cheaply, but having your own supply avoids pharmacy visits when you're feeling ill."

**What you pack for Delhi depends almost entirely on when you're going — the city swings from 5°C winter nights to 47°C summer afternoons.** Year-round essentials include modest clothing for religious sites, good walking shoes, sunscreen, and a basic medical kit. Here's the full breakdown by season.

## Winter (November - February)

This is peak tourist season, and the weather catches people off guard. Delhi winters are genuinely cold, especially December and January.

**Daytime temperatures:** 15-22°C (59-72°F). Comfortable in a light jacket.
**Nighttime/early morning:** 5-10°C (41-50°F). Some January mornings drop near freezing.

**Pack:**
- A proper warm jacket or down layer (not just a hoodie)
- Thermal base layer for early morning sightseeing
- Scarf and warm socks
- Closed-toe shoes — sandals won't cut it in January mornings
- Light layers for midday when it warms up
- A light sweater or fleece for layering

The fog in December-January is intense. Flights get delayed, and mornings at monuments are wrapped in mist. A warm hat helps for 6 AM starts at Qutub Minar or early [food tours through Old Delhi](/delhi/what-is-the-best-time-to-visit-delhi/).

## Summer (March - June)

March is pleasant. April is hot. May and June are punishing — 40-47°C (104-117°F) with dry, dusty heat.

**Pack:**
- Light cotton and linen clothing (avoid synthetics — they trap heat)
- A wide-brimmed hat or cap
- Sunglasses with UV protection
- High-SPF sunscreen (SPF 50+)
- A refillable water bottle (you'll drink 3-4 litres daily)
- A light cotton scarf for sun protection and dust
- Comfortable sandals with good grip

**Don't bring:** Dark-coloured clothing (absorbs heat), heavy denim, or anything that doesn't breathe. Pack whites and light colours.

In peak summer, you'll want to plan sightseeing for early morning and late afternoon, retreating to air-conditioned spaces midday. Check our [Delhi weather guide](/delhi/what-is-the-weather-like-in-delhi/) for month-by-month conditions.

## Monsoon (July - September)

Humid, rainy, and unpredictable. Downpours can last hours or hit in sudden 20-minute bursts. Streets flood regularly.

**Pack:**
- Quick-dry fabrics (cotton takes forever to dry in humidity)
- Waterproof shoes or sandals with good grip — Delhi's wet marble floors and flooded streets are slippery
- A compact rain jacket or travel umbrella
- Waterproof bag or dry bag for electronics
- Mosquito repellent (standing water means mosquitoes)
- Anti-fungal powder (humidity causes skin irritation)

## Year-Round Essentials

### Clothing for Religious Sites

You'll visit temples, mosques, and gurudwaras. All require modest dress.

- **Shoulders and knees covered.** Carry a light shawl or scarf in your daypack for quick cover-ups.
- **Head covering for gurudwaras and mosques.** Gurudwara Bangla Sahib provides free scarves at the entrance. For mosques like Jama Masjid, bring your own scarf.
- **Remove shoes at all religious sites.** You'll slip them off dozens of times. Shoes that are easy to take off and put on save time and frustration.

A single cotton scarf solves most of these requirements — it covers your head, wraps around shoulders, and folds small enough for a pocket.

### Footwear

You'll walk 10-20 km per day if you're sightseeing actively. Delhi's terrain includes uneven Old Delhi lanes, marble monument floors, dusty paths, and modern mall corridors — often in the same day.

- **One pair of comfortable walking shoes** with good support. Trainers or lightweight hiking shoes work.
- **One pair of sandals** for warm months or casual evenings. Something with a back strap — flip-flops are uncomfortable for long walks.

### Medical Kit

Pack these before you leave. Delhi pharmacies have everything, but you don't want to hunt for a pharmacy when you're sick.

- Loperamide (Imodium) — 10-12 tablets
- ORS sachets or electrolyte tablets
- Paracetamol and ibuprofen
- Antihistamines (cetirizine or loratadine)
- Hand sanitiser (carry a small bottle daily)
- Insect repellent with DEET
- Sunscreen (SPF 50+)
- Any prescription medications with a copy of the prescription
- Antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea (ask your doctor before departure)

See our full guide on [Delhi belly and how to avoid it](/delhi/what-is-delhi-belly-and-how-to-avoid-it/) for medical preparation details.

### Tech and Accessories

- **Universal power adapter.** India uses Type C and Type D sockets (round pins). Most international adapters include these, but check before you leave.
- **Portable power bank.** You'll use your phone heavily for maps, Uber, translation, and photos. A 10,000+ mAh bank keeps you going all day.
- **Unlocked phone.** You'll want an [Indian SIM card](/delhi/what-should-i-avoid-in-delhi/) for data, Uber, and maps. Make sure your phone is unlocked before arrival.
- **Ziplock bags.** For keeping your phone dry in monsoon season or protecting documents from sweat and rain.

### Other Essentials

- **Photocopy of your passport** (or a digital copy in your email). Keep the original locked in your hotel safe.
- **₹500-1,000 in small bills.** Many auto-rickshaw drivers and street vendors can't break ₹500 notes. Get small denominations from ATMs or ask your hotel to break larger notes.
- **A lightweight daypack.** Something you can comfortably carry for 8 hours of sightseeing with water, sunscreen, a scarf, and a power bank.

## What NOT to Pack

**Heavy jeans.** They're hot, slow to dry, and uncomfortable for all-day walking in warm months. Bring one pair maximum for winter evenings.

**Expensive jewellery.** Leave it at home. It attracts attention and creates anxiety you don't need.

**Too many clothes.** Delhi has excellent and cheap laundry services. Most hotels offer same-day laundry for ₹200-500 per load. Pack for 4-5 days and wash as you go.

**A huge suitcase.** Old Delhi lanes, metro staircases, and auto-rickshaws are not designed for full-size luggage. A medium backpack or rolling carry-on is ideal.

## What Clothes Should I Wear in Delhi?

It depends entirely on the season. October to February: layers — mornings and evenings are cold (5-15°C), but afternoons warm up. December-January specifically requires a proper jacket, scarf, and warm shoes. March to May: light cotton and linen, sunglasses, and a hat — temperatures hit 40-45°C. June to September: light, quick-dry fabrics for monsoon humidity and rain. Year-round, bring modest clothing that covers shoulders and knees for temple and mosque visits.

## Do I Need to Dress Conservatively in Delhi?

For religious sites, yes — cover your shoulders and knees at temples, mosques, and gurudwaras. Jama Masjid and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib both require head coverings (scarves provided at gurudwaras, bring your own for mosques). On regular streets, Delhi is a modern city and you'll see everything from jeans to saris. That said, dressing modestly in less touristy areas reduces unwanted attention, especially for women. Carry a light scarf that doubles as a head covering and a shoulder wrap.

## Should I Bring Medicine to Delhi?

Yes. Pack loperamide (Imodium) for stomach issues, ORS sachets or electrolyte tablets, basic painkillers (paracetamol/ibuprofen), antihistamines for allergies, and any prescription medications you take regularly. A course of antibiotics (azithromycin or ciprofloxacin) from your travel doctor is smart for severe traveller's diarrhea.
