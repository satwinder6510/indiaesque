faq:
  - question: "Which area is best for first-time visitors to Delhi?"
    answer: "Khan Market and Lodhi Road offer the most balanced experience - walkable streets, reliable restaurants, and easy access to both Old Delhi's monuments and New Delhi's government district. The area has consistent power backup and is well-connected by metro, making it practical for exploring the city's sprawling geography."
  - question: "How much should I expect to spend on accommodation in Delhi?"
    answer: "Mid-range hotels in central areas like Khan Market or Hauz Khas run ₹4,000-8,000 nightly. Premium properties in Lutyens' Delhi start around ₹12,000. Budget conscious travelers can find decent options in Paharganj from ₹1,500-3,000, though comfort levels vary significantly. Prices spike during peak season (October-March) and government conference periods."
  - question: "Is staying near the airport worth it for short trips?"
    answer: "For stays under 48 hours, Aerocity makes sense - modern hotels with reliable amenities and quick airport access. However, you'll miss Delhi's character entirely and spend significant time in traffic reaching the city center. Early morning flights justify airport proximity, but longer stays benefit from central locations."
  - question: "Which areas should I avoid for accommodation?"
    answer: "Most areas are manageable with proper research, but Karol Bagh can feel chaotic for those seeking calm. Areas far from metro lines become inconvenient quickly given Delhi's traffic patterns. Avoid booking solely based on low prices in outer residential areas unless you plan to stay put."
  - question: "Do I need to worry about power cuts when choosing accommodation?"
    answer: "Established hotels in central Delhi typically have generator backup, but smaller properties may experience interruptions during summer peak hours. Always confirm backup power availability when booking. Areas like Lutyens' Delhi and commercial zones generally have more stable supply than purely residential neighborhoods."

Delhi divides itself into distinct worlds - the ordered geometry of Lutyens' Delhi, the layered complexity of Old Delhi, the commercial energy of Connaught Place, and the residential calm of South Delhi's colonies. Your accommodation choice shapes more than convenience; it determines which version of the capital you encounter first each morning.

The city's geography works against casual exploration. Distances stretch longer than maps suggest, traffic patterns shift with government schedules, and metro connections don't always align with tourist logic. Where to stay in Delhi becomes less about finding a bed and more about positioning yourself within the city's sprawling narrative.

Unlike compact European capitals, Delhi rewards strategic thinking over spontaneous discovery when it comes to accommodation placement.

## What Shapes Your Stay

Access and atmosphere rarely align perfectly in Delhi. The areas with the most character - narrow lanes of Old Delhi, tree-lined avenues of Lutyens' - often present the steepest learning curves for navigation and modern conveniences.

Commercial districts offer predictable comforts but limited evening life once offices empty. The contrast between daytime energy and nighttime quiet strikes more dramatically here than in Mumbai's constantly active neighborhoods.

Residential colonies in South Delhi provide the most authentic glimpse of how the city actually lives, complete with morning yoga groups in parks and evening food vendors setting up their stalls. These areas feel removed from tourist Delhi entirely.

Metro proximity determines your exploration range more than any other single factor. Well-connected stations can unlock the city; poorly connected areas can strand you in traffic for hours during peak periods.

## Lutyens' Delhi

The geometric precision of Edwin Lutyens' urban plan still governs this central district, where wide avenues intersect at calculated angles and red sandstone buildings maintain their colonial dignity. Hotels here occupy converted heritage properties or modern buildings that respect the area's architectural grammar.

This remains Delhi's most composed neighborhood, where government officials take morning walks along tree-lined paths and the pace of life follows administrative rhythms rather than commercial urgency. The Imperial and similar properties charge accordingly - ₹15,000-25,000 per night - but deliver on the promise of staying within India's power center.

The area suits those who appreciate institutional quiet and don't mind that restaurants close early. You're walking distance from India Gate and Rajpath, though reaching Old Delhi requires planning around traffic patterns.

Less suited to spontaneous evening exploration, as the government district empties after office hours and food options remain limited compared to commercial areas.

## Khan Market & Lodhi Road

Khan Market manages to feel both central and residential, with covered shopping arcades that house everything from antiquarian bookshops to contemporary cafes. The surrounding Lodhi Road area provides tree cover and morning jogging paths that make early starts pleasant rather than challenging.

Accommodation here runs ₹6,000-12,000 for well-maintained properties with reliable generators and decent restaurant access. You're positioned between New and Old Delhi, with Lodhi Gardens providing green space and the market offering evening dining options that extend past typical government district hours.

This area works for those who want Delhi's benefits without its overwhelming intensity. The Lodhi metro station connects you efficiently to both airport and city center, while the neighborhood itself rewards walking at a pace that lets you observe daily life unfolding.

The market's afternoon crowds can feel stifling, and the area lacks the architectural drama of Lutyens' Delhi or the historic weight of Old Delhi.

## Hauz Khas Village

The medieval reservoir and tomb complex anchors a neighborhood that has evolved into Delhi's most design-conscious enclave. Narrow lanes house boutiques, galleries, and restaurants that stay open well past typical Delhi dinner hours, creating the closest approximation to European evening culture the city offers.

Hotels and guesthouses range from ₹4,000-10,000, often occupying converted houses that prioritize character over corporate amenities. You're trading marble lobbies for proximity to the city's most thoughtful retail and dining, plus easy access to the wooded paths around Hauz Khas Lake.

This suits travelers who prioritize evening options and don't mind that reaching Red Fort or India Gate requires metro connections and time planning. The village atmosphere makes it easy to settle into routines - morning walks around the lake, afternoon exploration of the ruins, evening restaurant hopping.

The area's popularity means weekend crowds and higher prices during peak season, when restaurant reservations become necessary rather than optional.

## Connaught Place

The Georgian colonnades of CP create Delhi's closest equivalent to a European city center - circular, walkable, and dense with commercial activity from morning through late evening. Hotels here range from budget options at ₹2,500-4,000 to business properties at ₹8,000-15,000.

You're positioned at Delhi's transportation hub, with multiple metro lines converging and bus connections radiating outward. The area pulses with energy that continues past typical Indian dinner hours, making it comfortable for evening wandering.

This works best for those who prefer urban density and don't mind that charm takes second place to convenience. You can walk to restaurants, banks, and shopping without planning around traffic, a rare privilege in Delhi.

The circular layout confuses first-time visitors, and the commercial focus means limited green space compared to residential areas.

## Paharganj

The narrow lanes near New Delhi Railway Station house budget accommodation from ₹1,500-3,500, with varying levels of cleanliness and noise management. This area serves budget-conscious travelers who spend minimal time in their rooms and don't mind navigating crowded streets.

You're walking distance from the railway station and Old Delhi, with cheap food options and travel services concentrated in the immediate area. The neighborhood operates on traveler logic rather than local residential patterns.

## Aerocity & Airport Area

Modern hotels near the airport charge ₹8,000-20,000 for international chain reliability and quick departure convenience. This makes sense for business travelers or those with early flights, though you sacrifice any connection to Delhi's character for predictable amenities and climate control.

## Booking Strategy

Peak season pricing (October through March) can double accommodation costs, particularly around Diwali and Christmas when advance booking becomes essential rather than advisable.

Generator backup matters more than star ratings during summer months when power cuts affect comfort levels significantly. Always confirm backup power availability when making reservations.

Metro proximity saves hours of daily commute time that adds up over multi-day stays. Check walking distance to stations rather than relying on "near metro" descriptions.

Street-facing rooms in central areas deal with traffic noise throughout the night, while inner courtyard rooms stay quieter but may have limited natural light.

Direct hotel booking often yields better generator priority and room location than third-party platforms, particularly for properties under 50 rooms.

Early flight departures (before 7 AM) from Indira Gandhi Airport justify staying in Aerocity or Mahipalpur rather than dealing with pre-dawn traffic from central Delhi.

Book heritage properties well in advance during wedding season (December-February) when Indian domestic travel peaks and available rooms disappear quickly.
