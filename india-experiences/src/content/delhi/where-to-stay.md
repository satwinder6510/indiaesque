faq:
  - question: "What is the best area to stay in Delhi for tourists?"
    answer: "Connaught Place (CP) is best for first-time visitors — central location, excellent metro access at Rajiv Chowk, walking distance to India Gate, and plenty of restaurants. Hotels range from ₹3,000-25,000 ($35-300) per night."
  - question: "Is Paharganj safe for tourists?"
    answer: "Paharganj is safe but chaotic. It's Delhi's budget backpacker hub opposite New Delhi Railway Station. Expect noise, touts, and basic accommodation from ₹500 ($6) per night. Fine for a night or two, but most travelers prefer quieter areas."
  - question: "Should I stay in South Delhi or Central Delhi?"
    answer: "Central Delhi (CP, Karol Bagh) is better for sightseeing — closer to monuments and Old Delhi. South Delhi (Hauz Khas, Defence Colony) is better for restaurants, nightlife, and a quieter residential feel. Both have good metro access."

Choosing where to stay in Delhi depends on what you want from your trip. The city sprawls across 1,500+ square kilometres, and location matters more here than in most cities. Pick the wrong area and you'll spend hours in traffic. Pick right and you'll have metro access to everything that matters.

This guide breaks down Delhi's main tourist areas with honest assessments, price ranges, and transport links. For your overall Delhi planning, see the [Delhi city guide](/delhi/).

## Connaught Place (CP) — Best for First-Timers

Connaught Place is Delhi's colonial-era commercial heart — a circular arcade of white colonnaded buildings designed by the British in the 1930s. It's central, well-connected, and the obvious base for first-time visitors.

**Pros:**
- Rajiv Chowk metro station (Yellow + Blue lines) — the most connected interchange in Delhi
- Walking distance to India Gate, Jantar Mantar, and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib
- Plenty of restaurants, cafes, and shops
- Safe, well-lit, and patrolled

**Cons:**
- Expensive by Delhi standards
- Can feel corporate and sterile
- Street touts around the outer circle

**Hotels:**
- **Budget:** Backpacker hostels ₹800-1,500 ($10-18) — Zostel, Moustache
- **Mid-range:** ₹3,000-6,000 ($35-70) — Hotel Palace Heights, The Lalit Great Eastern
- **Luxury:** ₹10,000-25,000 ($120-300) — The Imperial, Shangri-La Eros

**Best for:** First-timers, short stays, business travellers wanting central access.

## South Delhi — Best for Food & Nightlife

South Delhi is where the city's restaurants, bars, and boutiques cluster. It's residential, leafy, and quieter than Central Delhi — but still well-connected by metro (Yellow and Magenta lines).

### Hauz Khas Village

A medieval village turned hipster enclave. Art galleries, cafes, boutiques, and bars surround a 14th-century reservoir and madrasa. Best for younger travellers who want nightlife on their doorstep.

- Metro: Green Park (Yellow Line) — 10-minute walk
- Hotels/Airbnbs: ₹2,500-8,000 ($30-95)

### Defence Colony & Greater Kailash

Upscale residential areas with excellent restaurants (Defence Colony Market, M Block GK). Quieter than Hauz Khas, more family-friendly.

- Metro: Lajpat Nagar (Violet Line), Kailash Colony (Violet Line)
- Hotels/Airbnbs: ₹3,000-12,000 ($35-140)

### Saket & Malviya Nagar

Near Select Citywalk mall and Champa Gali (Delhi's best coffee lane). Good metro access on Magenta Line.

- Metro: Saket, Malviya Nagar
- Hotels: ₹2,500-7,000 ($30-85)

**Best for:** Foodies, nightlife seekers, longer stays, travellers who've seen Delhi before.

---

## Karol Bagh — Best Budget-to-Midrange

Karol Bagh is a dense commercial neighbourhood northwest of Connaught Place. It's not glamorous, but it offers the best value for mid-budget travellers.

**Pros:**
- Karol Bagh metro station (Blue Line) — direct to Old Delhi and airport
- Hundreds of hotels from ₹1,200 ($15) upward
- Great street food and local restaurants
- Real Delhi neighbourhood feel

**Cons:**
- Noisy and crowded
- Limited nightlife
- Not as polished as CP

**Hotels:**
- **Budget:** ₹1,200-2,500 ($15-30) — Hotel Hari Piorko, Bajaj Indian Homestay
- **Mid-range:** ₹2,500-5,000 ($30-60) — Hotel Metro Tower, Hotel Clark Heights

**Best for:** Budget travellers, families, those who want a local feel without Paharganj chaos.

## Paharganj — The Backpacker Strip

Paharganj is the narrow lane opposite New Delhi Railway Station that's been hosting budget travellers since the 1970s. It's gritty, loud, and full of character — or chaos, depending on your perspective.

**Pros:**
- Cheapest accommodation in central Delhi (₹500-1,500 / $6-18)
- Walking distance to New Delhi station and metro
- Backpacker vibe if that's your thing
- Pharmacies, travel agents, and ATMs everywhere

**Cons:**
- Aggressive touts
- Noise from 6am onwards
- Rooms are basic at best
- Not representative of Delhi

**Hotels:** Smyle Inn, Hotel Namaskar, Zostel Paharganj

**Best for:** Backpackers on tight budgets, travellers with early trains, those who enjoy gritty urban texture. Read our detailed [Paharganj guide](/delhi/paharganj-is-it-worth-staying/) before booking.

## Aerocity — Best for Airport Access

Aerocity is the strip of corporate hotels along the Airport Express Metro line, 5-10 minutes from Terminal 3. Zero character, but maximum convenience for late arrivals or early departures.

**Pros:**
- 5-10 minutes to airport by metro or taxi
- Modern hotels with consistent quality
- Restaurants and bars within walking distance

**Cons:**
- Soulless corporate zone
- Far from tourist sights
- Expensive for what you get

**Hotels:**
- **Mid-range:** ₹4,000-8,000 ($50-95) — ibis, Holiday Inn
- **Luxury:** ₹10,000-20,000 ($120-240) — JW Marriott, Pullman, Andaz

**Best for:** Transit stays, business travellers, those arriving late or leaving early.

---

## Nizamuddin & Sunder Nursery Area — Heritage Stay

The area around Humayun's Tomb and Nizamuddin Dargah is quieter than Central Delhi and puts you close to Delhi's finest Mughal heritage. Limited hotel options, but some excellent boutique stays.

**Pros:**
- Walking distance to Humayun's Tomb, Sunder Nursery, Nizamuddin Dargah
- Thursday evening qawwali at the dargah
- Quieter than central areas

**Cons:**
- Limited hotel choices
- Fewer restaurants
- Need metro/taxi for other sights

**Notable stays:** The Manor, Haveli Dharampura (Old Delhi)

**Best for:** Heritage lovers, second-time visitors, those seeking quieter Delhi.

---

## What To Avoid

**Gurugram (Gurgaon):** Often recommended for its malls and restaurants, but it's technically a different city — 30-60 minutes from central Delhi in traffic. Only stay here if you have specific business there.

**IGI Airport area (non-Aerocity):** Some hotels advertise "near airport" but are actually in industrial zones or highway-side locations. Stick to Aerocity proper.

**Random suburbs:** Without specific recommendations, avoid booking hotels in places like Dwarka, Rohini, or Noida — they're far from tourist sights with limited character.

## Transport From Each Area

| Area | To Old Delhi | To Humayun's Tomb | To South Delhi |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Connaught Place | 15 min metro | 20 min metro/taxi | 20 min metro |
| Karol Bagh | 20 min metro | 30 min metro | 25 min metro |
| Paharganj | 15 min metro | 25 min metro/taxi | 25 min metro |
| Hauz Khas | 30 min metro | 25 min metro/taxi | Already there |

## Booking Tips

1. **Book direct for negotiation:** Many mid-range hotels offer better rates if you call directly or walk in.

2. **Check AC status:** In summer (April-July), working AC is essential. Confirm it's not "cooler" (evaporative cooling — useless in Delhi humidity).

3. **Read recent reviews:** Hotels in Delhi can deteriorate quickly. Check reviews from the last 3-6 months.

4. **Consider Airbnb in South Delhi:** Better value than hotels in residential neighbourhoods, often with kitchen access.

5. **Airport transfers:** Most mid-range+ hotels offer airport pickup. Confirm price before accepting — it should be ₹600-1,000 ($7-12) from T3.

## Our Recommendations

**3 nights, first visit:** Connaught Place. Central location, easy metro access to everything.

**5+ nights, want local feel:** Karol Bagh (budget) or Hauz Khas (mid-range). Balance of value and character.

**Transit/layover:** Aerocity. No-nonsense airport proximity.

**Heritage focus:** Nizamuddin area or Old Delhi. Wake up near the monuments.
