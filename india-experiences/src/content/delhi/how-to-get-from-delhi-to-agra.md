  - question: "What is the fastest train from Delhi to Agra?"
    answer: "The Gatimaan Express is the fastest train from Delhi to Agra, covering the distance in 1 hour 40 minutes. It departs from Hazrat Nizamuddin station in Delhi and arrives at Agra Cantt station. The fare is ₹750 ($9) for AC Chair Car and ₹1,500 ($18) for Executive Class, which includes a meal onboard. Book through IRCTC at least 3-5 days ahead during peak season (October-March)."
  - question: "How much does a taxi from Delhi to Agra cost?"
    answer: "A hired car with driver from Delhi to Agra and back costs ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) for a return trip, including tolls, parking, and the driver's waiting time while you sightsee. The trip takes 3-4 hours each way via the Yamuna Expressway. Book through your hotel, Savaari, or GetMeCab. A one-way Uber Intercity ride costs ₹2,500-4,000 ($30-48) but isn't ideal for day trips."
  - question: "Should I take the train or drive from Delhi to Agra?"
    answer: "Take the train if you want speed, comfort, and predictability — the Gatimaan Express takes 1 hour 40 minutes regardless of traffic. Drive if you want door-to-door flexibility, are travelling in a group of 3-4 (which makes the per-person car cost comparable to train tickets), or want to stop at places along the way like Mathura or Sikandra. The train is the better choice for most visitors."

**The fastest way to get from Delhi to Agra is the Gatimaan Express, which takes 1 hour 40 minutes from Hazrat Nizamuddin station and costs ₹750-1,500 ($9-18) depending on class — it's more reliable, more comfortable, and faster than driving, which takes 3-4 hours via the Yamuna Expressway.** Here's every option compared, with booking tips and practical advice for 2026.

## Option 1: Gatimaan Express (Recommended)

The Gatimaan Express is India's fastest conventional train on the Delhi-Agra route and the most practical choice for the vast majority of visitors.

### Schedule

| Direction | Departs | Arrives | Duration |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Delhi to Agra | Hazrat Nizamuddin, 8:10 AM | Agra Cantt, 9:50 AM | 1h 40min |
| Agra to Delhi | Agra Cantt, 5:50 PM | Hazrat Nizamuddin, 7:30 PM | 1h 40min |

This schedule gives you roughly 8 hours in Agra — subtract travel time between Agra Cantt station and the Taj Mahal (20-30 minutes by auto-rickshaw) and you have about 6-7 solid hours for sightseeing. That's comfortable for the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and lunch.

### Fares

| Class | Price | What You Get |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| AC Chair Car (CC) | ₹750 ($9) | Air-conditioned reclining seats, decent legroom |
| Executive Class (EC) | ₹1,500 ($18) | Wider seats, meal included onboard, less crowded |

Executive Class is worth the upgrade. The meal is a full Indian breakfast (poha or upma, bread, butter, tea/coffee), and the carriage is quieter with fewer passengers.

### How to Book

Book through **IRCTC** (irctc.co.in or the IRCTC Rail Connect app). You'll need to create an account, which requires an Indian mobile number for OTP verification. If you don't have an Indian SIM, ask your hotel to help — most front desks will assist with IRCTC bookings.

**Book 3-5 days ahead** during October-March (peak tourist season). The train frequently sells out. If it's full, check for **Tatkal** (last-minute) tickets, which open at 10:00 AM the day before travel — they cost a premium but are often available when regular tickets are sold out.

**Tip:** Hazrat Nizamuddin station is in South Delhi, not the same as New Delhi Railway Station. Budget 30-45 minutes to reach Nizamuddin from central Delhi by metro or taxi. The nearest metro station is Hazrat Nizamuddin (Violet/Pink Line).

### At the Station

Hazrat Nizamuddin is a medium-sized station. The Gatimaan Express departs from a regular platform — check the display boards for the platform number when you arrive. There's a basic waiting room, food stalls, and usable toilet facilities. Arrive 20-30 minutes before departure. The train leaves on time.

## Option 2: Shatabdi Express

The Shatabdi Express is the Gatimaan's older sibling on this route.

| Direction | Departs | Arrives | Duration |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Delhi to Agra | New Delhi station, 6:00 AM | Agra Cantt, 8:10 AM | 2h 10min |
| Agra to Delhi | Agra Cantt, 8:15 PM | New Delhi, 10:30 PM | 2h 15min |

The Shatabdi is slightly slower but departs from **New Delhi Railway Station** (Paharganj side), which is more central for visitors staying in Connaught Place or Paharganj. The return is later (8:15 PM), giving you about 2 extra hours in Agra compared to the Gatimaan.

**Fares:** ₹600-1,200 ($7-14) for Chair Car, ₹1,500-1,800 ($18-22) for Executive. Meals included in both classes.

**Book through IRCTC**, same process as the Gatimaan. The Shatabdi runs daily except certain holidays — check the schedule on the IRCTC website.

### Gatimaan vs Shatabdi: Which One?

| Factor | Gatimaan Express | Shatabdi Express |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Speed | 1h 40min | 2h 10min |
| Departure station | Hazrat Nizamuddin | New Delhi |
| Return arrives Delhi | 7:30 PM | 10:30 PM |
| Time in Agra | ~8 hours | ~12 hours |
| Best for | Day trippers who want to be back early | Visitors who want more time in Agra |

If you only want the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort, the Gatimaan's schedule is ideal. If you want to add Fatehpur Sikri or Itimad-ud-Daulah (Baby Taj), the Shatabdi's later return gives you breathing room.

## Option 3: Private Car with Driver

Hiring a car with driver is the flexible option — it picks you up from your hotel, drops you at the Taj Mahal gate, waits while you sightsee, and drives you back whenever you're ready.

### Details

- **Route:** NH-2 via Yamuna Expressway (the fastest road route)
- **Distance:** 233 km
- **Travel time:** 3-4 hours each way (the variable is Delhi traffic getting onto the expressway)
- **Cost:** ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) for a round trip with driver, including tolls and parking
- **Vehicle:** Typically a Toyota Innova or similar AC sedan/SUV

### How to Book

- **Through your hotel:** Most Delhi hotels arrange cars for ₹3,500-5,000. Convenient but slightly more expensive.
- **Savaari** (savaari.com): Reliable online car rental. Book 24 hours ahead. Prices from ₹3,000.
- **GetMeCab** (getmecab.com): Similar service and pricing.
- **Uber Intercity:** Available for one-way trips (₹2,500-4,000), but not ideal for day trips since you'd need to book a separate return.

### When Driving Makes Sense

A car is the better choice when:
- You're a group of 3-4 people (the per-person cost drops to ₹750-1,250, comparable to a train ticket)
- You want to stop at Sikandra (Akbar's Tomb, 10 km before Agra) or Mathura (Krishna's birthplace, 50 km before Agra)
- You missed the Gatimaan Express booking window
- You have mobility issues and want door-to-door service
- You want to visit Fatehpur Sikri (40 km west of Agra), which is difficult to reach by train

### When Driving Doesn't Make Sense

- Solo travellers or couples (the train is cheaper and faster)
- During monsoon season (July-September) when the expressway can have waterlogging
- If you need to be back in Delhi by a specific time (traffic is unpredictable)

## Option 4: Bus (Not Recommended)

Government and private buses run between Delhi and Agra from the Anand Vihar ISBT (Inter-State Bus Terminal) and Sarai Kale Khan terminal. The journey takes 4-6 hours depending on stops, traffic, and the condition of the bus.

**Why we don't recommend it:** The buses are slow, often uncomfortable, and stop frequently. The Yamuna Expressway AC Volvo buses are slightly better (₹600-900, 3.5-4 hours), but they still can't match the train for speed, reliability, or comfort. The only advantage is that bus tickets are available last-minute when trains are sold out.

If you're stuck, the **UP State Roadways AC bus** from Anand Vihar is the least bad option. Departs every 30 minutes throughout the day.

## Complete Comparison Table

| Method | Time | Cost (per person) | Cost (total) | Comfort | Book ahead? |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Gatimaan Express | 1h 40min | ₹750-1,500 ($9-18) | ₹750-1,500 | Excellent | 3-5 days |
| Shatabdi Express | 2h 10min | ₹600-1,800 ($7-22) | ₹600-1,800 | Excellent | 3-5 days |
| Private car (group of 4) | 3-4 hours | ₹750-1,250 ($9-15) | ₹3,000-5,000 | Good | 24 hours |
| Private car (solo) | 3-4 hours | ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) | ₹3,000-5,000 | Good | 24 hours |
| Bus | 4-6 hours | ₹400-900 ($5-11) | ₹400-900 | Poor | Not needed |

## Getting from Agra Cantt Station to the Taj Mahal

If you take the train, you'll arrive at Agra Cantt station, which is about 6 km from the Taj Mahal.

- **Prepaid auto-rickshaw:** ₹150-200 ($1.80-2.40). Look for the prepaid booth outside the station — this avoids haggling.
- **Uber or Ola:** ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40). Both work reliably in Agra.
- **Prepaid taxi:** ₹300-400 ($3.60-4.80).

**Avoid touts** who offer "free" rides in exchange for visiting marble or carpet shops. Use the prepaid booth or ride-hailing apps exclusively. For more on this, see our guide on [avoiding scams](/delhi/how-to-avoid-scams-in-delhi/).

## Practical Tips for the Journey

**The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays.** Plan your trip for any other day of the week.

**Carry cash in Agra.** Many auto-rickshaws, street food vendors, and smaller attractions don't accept cards or UPI. Bring ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) in small denominations.

**Return timing matters.** If you're taking the 5:50 PM Gatimaan back, leave the Taj Mahal area by 4:30 PM. If driving, leave Agra by 4:00-5:00 PM to avoid arriving in Delhi too late.

**Combining with other stops.** If you're driving, you can combine Agra with a stop at Mathura and Vrindavan (Krishna's birthplace, 58 km north of Agra) on the way. This turns a day trip into a 12-14 hour excursion — ambitious but doable. See our [Mathura and Vrindavan guide](/delhi/day-trip-to-mathura-and-vrindavan-from-delhi/) for details.

**Luggage:** If you're continuing from Agra to Jaipur (the classic Golden Triangle route) instead of returning to Delhi, trains connect Agra to Jaipur in 3-4 hours. Book through IRCTC.
