**Surajkund Mela is an annual two-week international crafts fair held in Faridabad (30 km south of Delhi), where artisans from all 28 Indian states and over a dozen countries sell handicrafts, textiles, pottery, and folk art under one sprawling open-air complex.** It runs from approximately 1-15 February each year and draws over a million visitors.

Organised by the Haryana Tourism Corporation and the Surajkund Mela Authority, this is India's largest crafts fair. Each year, one Indian state is designated the "theme state" and gets a featured pavilion showcasing its arts and culture. The fair also invites a partner country — past participants include Japan, Thailand, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, and several African nations.

For tourists visiting Delhi in February, Surajkund Mela is a half-day trip that gives you concentrated access to India's regional craft traditions in one place.

## What You'll Find at the Mela

The fair is organised into several zones spread across a large, landscaped site near the ancient Surajkund reservoir (a 10th-century tank built by the Tomar king Surajpal).

### Crafts Pavilions

This is the core of the mela. Hundreds of stalls are arranged by state and craft type:

- **Textiles** — Banarasi silk from Uttar Pradesh, Kanchipuram silk from Tamil Nadu, Phulkari embroidery from Punjab, Ikat weaves from Odisha and Telangana, Chanderi from Madhya Pradesh, and Patola from Gujarat
- **Pottery and ceramics** — blue pottery from Jaipur, black clay pottery from Manipur, terracotta from Bengal, Khurja ceramics from UP
- **Metalwork** — Bidriware from Karnataka, Dhokra tribal casting from Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, brasswork from Moradabad
- **Woodwork** — rosewood carvings from Kerala, sandalwood from Karnataka, Channapatna wooden toys from Karnataka
- **Paintings** — Madhubani from Bihar, Warli from Maharashtra, Pattachitra from Odisha, Gond from Madhya Pradesh, Kalamkari from Andhra Pradesh
- **Jewellery** — tribal silver from Rajasthan and the Northeast, lac bangles, Kundan and Meenakari work from Rajasthan

Prices are generally fair. Artisans sell directly, cutting out middlemen. Light bargaining (10-15% off) is acceptable at most stalls, though some artisans have fixed prices. A Madhubani painting that might cost ₹1,500 in a Delhi gallery could be ₹500-800 here bought directly from the artist.

### International Pavilions

The partner country section features crafts from around 20 nations. You'll find Thai silk, African beadwork, Central Asian textiles, Japanese crafts, and more depending on the year's participants. These pavilions are interesting for comparison shopping and often have unique items you won't find elsewhere in Delhi.

### Food Court — The Other Star Attraction

The food section at Surajkund Mela rivals the crafts for visitor attention. Each Indian state operates its own food stall, serving regional specialities:

- Rajasthani dal baati churma and ker sangri
- Kashmiri wazwan dishes and kahwa tea
- Bengali fish curry and rosogolla
- Coorgi pandi pork curry from Karnataka
- Naga smoked pork from the Northeast
- Punjabi tandoori chicken and makki ki roti with sarson ka saag

Dishes cost ₹100-300 ($1.20-3.60) per plate. The food quality is solid — these are state tourism board-sponsored stalls with a reputation to maintain. Eat your way through several states in one sitting.

### Cultural Performances

The mela features daily performances on an open-air stage, typically from 3:00 PM onwards:

- Folk dance troupes from the theme state
- Musical performances — Sufi singers, classical musicians, folk artists
- Puppet shows and theatrical performances
- Dance-drama presentations from different regions
- International cultural troupes from partner countries

The evening performances (5:00-7:30 PM) tend to be the best. Grab food from the stalls and watch from the tiered seating area.

## Practical Details

**Location**: Surajkund, Faridabad, Haryana — approximately 30 km from central Delhi, 8 km from the Delhi-Haryana border at Badarpur.

**Dates**: Typically 1-15 February (check Haryana Tourism's website for exact dates each year).

**Hours**: 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM daily.

**Entry fee**: ₹180 ($2.15) for adults, ₹80 ($0.96) for children (5-12 years). Weekend tickets are sometimes priced slightly higher. Tickets are available at the gate — no advance booking needed.

**Time needed**: Budget 3-5 hours for a thorough visit. One hour for crafts, one hour for food, and extra time for performances and browsing. If you want to shop seriously, allow a full day.

## Getting There from Delhi

### By Car or Taxi

The most convenient option. From Connaught Place, take Mathura Road south towards Faridabad. Cross the Badarpur border and follow signs to Surajkund. The drive takes 45-60 minutes depending on traffic. An Uber or Ola will cost ₹400-600 ($4.80-7.20) one way from central Delhi.

**Parking**: There's a large parking area at the mela grounds. Expect ₹50-100 for car parking. On weekends, parking fills up by noon — arrive early.

### By Metro + Shuttle Bus

During the mela period, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) typically runs shuttle buses from select metro stations (usually Badarpur or Escorts Mujesar on the Violet Line). The shuttle costs ₹30-50 and drops you at the mela entrance. This option is cheaper but adds 30-40 minutes to your journey.

### By Auto-Rickshaw

Autos from the Badarpur metro station to Surajkund are available but negotiate the fare before getting in — expect ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40).

## Best Days and Times to Visit

**Weekdays** (Monday through Thursday) are dramatically less crowded than weekends. If you can visit on a Tuesday or Wednesday, you'll have a much more relaxed experience — easier to browse stalls, talk to artisans, and find seats near the performance stage.

**Weekends** draw massive crowds, especially during the second week when word of mouth has spread. Saturday and Sunday afternoons are the peak. If you must visit on a weekend, arrive by 10:30 AM when the gates open.

**The first 2-3 days** of the mela are quieter, since many Delhi residents wait until the second week. The opening day sometimes features an inauguration ceremony with cultural performances.

**Evenings** (4:00-7:30 PM) have the best atmosphere — the temperature cools, performances are in full swing, and the food court lights up.

## What to Buy — Best Value Picks

For souvenirs, Surajkund offers excellent value because you're buying from artisans rather than retail shops. Some of the best deals:

- **Pashmina shawls** from Kashmir: ₹3,000-15,000 ($36-180) — significantly less than airport shops
- **Madhubani paintings**: ₹500-5,000 ($6-60) depending on size
- **Chikankari kurtas** from Lucknow: ₹800-3,000 ($9.60-36)
- **Blue pottery** from Jaipur: ₹200-2,000 ($2.40-24)
- **Dhokra metalwork**: ₹300-3,000 ($3.60-36) for decorative pieces
- **Handmade jewellery**: ₹200-5,000+ ($2.40-60+) depending on material

## Tips for Your Visit

- **Wear comfortable shoes** — the grounds are large and mostly unpaved. Walking 3-4 km over the course of a visit is normal.
- **Carry cash** — many artisan stalls only accept cash. ATMs are available on-site but queues can be long. UPI payments are accepted at some stalls.
- **Bring a bag** for purchases — a foldable tote works well.
- **Sunscreen and a hat** — February in Delhi is mild but sunny. Afternoons can reach 22-25 degrees C.
- **Combine with other [winter activities](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-in-winter/)** in Delhi — February is peak sightseeing season.
