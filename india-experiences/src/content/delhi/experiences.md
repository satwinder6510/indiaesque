The standard Delhi itinerary hits Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, and India Gate. These are worth seeing — but the experiences that actually change how you understand the city happen in someone's kitchen, on a bicycle at 6am, or sitting cross-legged at a Sufi shrine on a Thursday night.

This guide covers Delhi's best participatory experiences — the things you do, not just look at. Prices are in INR with USD equivalents, and we've included booking details where available. For the broader trip picture, see the [Delhi city guide](/delhi/).

## Cooking Classes

Cooking classes are the single best experience you can book in Delhi. Not because the cooking is difficult — it isn't — but because they get you inside a home, shopping at a local market, and sitting down to eat what you've made with the person who taught you.

### How Home Cooking Classes Work

The typical format runs 4-5 hours:

1. **Market visit (45-60 minutes):** Your host takes you to their local vegetable market — not a tourist market, but the one they actually use. You buy fresh vegetables, spices, paneer, meat if needed. The host explains what to look for, what's in season, and how to judge quality. This market trip alone teaches you more about Indian food than most cooking shows.

2. **Cooking (2-3 hours):** Back at the home kitchen, you cook 4-5 dishes together. A typical vegetarian menu includes dal (lentil curry), aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower), paneer butter masala, roti or paratha (flatbreads made on a tawa), and a dessert like kheer (rice pudding). Non-vegetarian versions swap in chicken curry, keema (minced meat), or butter chicken.

3. **Eating (30-45 minutes):** You sit down and eat everything you've cooked, usually with chai. The host sends you home with printed or emailed recipes.

### Prices and Booking

**Home cooking classes:** ₹2,000-3,500 ($25-42) per person for a group session, ₹3,500-5,000 ($42-60) for private. Most hosts accommodate 2-6 guests per session.

**Professional cooking school classes:** ₹4,000-8,000 ($48-96) per person. These run from proper kitchen studios with professional equipment. More polished, less personal.

**What's included:** All ingredients, recipes, chai/water, and the meal you cook. Some hosts include a market tote bag or spice kit to take home.

Book at least 3-5 days in advance during peak season (October-March). Most hosts list on Airbnb Experiences, Viator, or their own websites. Private classes can sometimes accommodate same-day bookings if the host has an opening.

## Cycling Tours

Delhi at 6am is a different city. The air is cooler, the roads are empty, the light is soft, and Old Delhi's lanes are quiet enough to hear the dough being slapped for morning parathas. This is when the cycling tours operate, and the early start is non-negotiable — by 9am, the traffic makes cycling through Old Delhi genuinely dangerous.

### What To Expect

Tours typically run 3-4 hours, covering 12-15 km on hybrid bicycles. The route threads through Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) — down Chandni Chowk before the shops open, through the lanes behind Jama Masjid, past the spice market at Khari Baoli, and along the Yamuna riverbank. Stops include chai stalls, a flower market, a wholesale fruit market, and sometimes a Sikh gurudwara where you can join the langar (community kitchen serving free meals).

The cycling is easy — flat terrain, slow pace, and the guide handles the route. You don't need to be fit or an experienced cyclist. The bikes are well-maintained with gears and comfortable seats.

### Prices and Booking

**Group cycling tours:** ₹1,500-2,000 ($18-25) per person. Groups of 6-12 riders.
**Private cycling tours:** ₹2,500-4,000 ($30-48) per person (minimum 2 people).

Delhi By Cycle is the original operator and still the most established. Several other operators now run similar routes. Book 2-3 days ahead during peak season.

Start time is fixed: 6:00-6:30am. You meet at a designated point in Old Delhi (usually near Jama Masjid or Delhi Gate) and finish by 9:30-10:00am. Some tours end with breakfast included; others drop you near Chandni Chowk metro so you can continue your day.

## Street Art: Lodhi Art District

The Lodhi Art District runs for about a kilometre along Lodhi Road, between Lodhi Gardens and Khanna Market. Starting in 2015, the St+art India Foundation invited international and Indian artists to paint the walls of this residential government colony. The result is one of India's largest open-air art galleries — massive murals on apartment blocks, transformer boxes, boundary walls, and pillars.

### What You'll See

The murals cover everything from photorealistic portraits to abstract geometry to pointed social commentary. Notable works include pieces by Anpu Varkey (India), Hendrik Beikirch (Germany), and Hanif Kureshi (India). The art rotates — new pieces are added during the annual St+art Delhi festival, usually in January or February.

### Visiting Details

**Cost:** Free. It's a public neighbourhood — you walk along the streets and look up.
**Best time:** Morning light (7:00-10:00am) is best for photography. The murals face different directions, so some are better in afternoon light.
**How to get there:** The closest metro is Jor Bagh (Yellow Line), a 10-minute walk. Or take an auto/Uber to Lodhi Colony.
**Duration:** 1-2 hours for a thorough walk.
**Guided walks:** St+art India occasionally runs guided walks during festival season. Otherwise, self-guided is easy — the murals are visible from the street.

Combine this with a visit to Lodhi Gardens, which is directly adjacent. The gardens contain 15th-century tombs set in 90 acres of parkland — free entry, open sunrise to sunset. See our [best photography spots in Delhi](/delhi/best-photography-spots-in-delhi/) for more locations.

## Sufi Qawwali at Nizamuddin Dargah

Every Thursday evening, qawwali singers perform Sufi devotional music at the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, a 14th-century saint whose dargah sits at the heart of Nizamuddin Basti. This is not a tourist performance — it's a living spiritual practice that's been continuous for over 700 years.

### What Happens

After the evening (Maghrib) prayer, usually around 6:30-7:00pm, a group of qawwals sets up in the courtyard of the dargah. They play harmonium and tabla, and the lead singer begins a qawwali — a call-and-response devotional song in Urdu, Hindi, or Persian. The music builds in intensity over 20-40 minutes. Listeners sit on the marble floor around the musicians.

The experience is emotional even if you don't understand the words. The music, the setting, the scent of rose petals and incense, the devotion of the people around you — it's one of those Delhi experiences that stays with you long after you leave.

### Visiting Details

**Cost:** Free. No tickets, no booking.
**When:** Thursday evenings. Arrive by 6:30-7:00pm for a good spot. The performance runs until 9:00-9:30pm.
**Dress code:** Conservative clothing. Cover your shoulders and knees. Women should bring a scarf to cover their head. Remove shoes before entering the dargah compound.
**How to get there:** Hazrat Nizamuddin metro station (Pink Line) is a 10-minute walk. By Uber, ask for Nizamuddin Dargah and walk from the drop-off point through the basti lanes.
**Photography:** Ask before photographing people at prayer. General shots of the architecture and performance are usually fine.

## Photography Walks

Delhi is absurdly photogenic if you know where to point a camera. The mix of Mughal architecture, narrow Old Delhi lanes, modern street art, colourful markets, and sheer human density creates images you can't get anywhere else.

### Best Photography Routes

**Old Delhi lanes (morning):** The lanes behind Jama Masjid between 6:00-9:00am offer the best street photography in Delhi. Butchers setting up shop, chai stalls steaming, cycle rickshaws loaded with improbable cargo, light falling through gaps between buildings. Start at Delhi Gate metro and walk north toward Jama Masjid.

**Humayun's Tomb (late afternoon):** The warm light between 3:30-5:00pm turns the red sandstone orange. The reflecting pools double the symmetry. It's the single most photogenic monument in Delhi.

**Lodhi Art District (morning):** The street art murals photograph best in soft morning light. Some faces on the murals are three storeys tall.

**Chandni Chowk (evening):** The bazaar lights up after dark — neon signs, cooking fires, and phone screens create a layered chaos of light. Go between 6:00-8:00pm.

Guided photography walks cost ₹2,000-4,000 ($25-48) per person and pair a local photographer-guide with small groups. They know the light, the angles, and the lanes that lead to the best frames.

## Bollywood Dance Workshops

Several studios in Delhi run Bollywood dance workshops aimed at tourists — 1-2 hour sessions where you learn a choreographed routine to a Hindi film song. No dance experience required. These are fun, high-energy, and a solid ice-breaker for group travel.

**Prices:** ₹1,000-2,500 ($12-30) per person for a group workshop. Private sessions cost more.
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.
**Where:** Studios in Hauz Khas, Connaught Place, and South Delhi. Some operators come to your hotel.

Read our [Bollywood experience in Delhi](/delhi/bollywood-experience-in-delhi/) guide for specific operators.

## Yoga Classes For Visitors

Delhi has a strong yoga culture, and several studios and teachers offer drop-in classes and short courses for tourists. The quality ranges from excellent traditional practice to Instagram-friendly gimmicks.

**Drop-in classes** at established studios cost ₹500-1,500 ($6-18) per session. Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre in South Delhi and Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga near Connaught Place both accept drop-ins. Bring your own mat or rent one for ₹100-200.

**Private sessions** cost ₹2,000-5,000 ($25-60) per hour, usually at your hotel or the teacher's studio.

**Multi-day courses** for serious practitioners are available at ashrams in South Delhi and at Isha Yoga Centre (though the main campus is in Coimbatore, not Delhi).

See our [yoga classes for tourists in Delhi](/delhi/yoga-classes-in-delhi-for-tourists/) guide for specific recommendations.

## Nightlife

Delhi's nightlife runs later and louder than you might expect. The main nightlife areas are Hauz Khas Village (bars, rooftops), Connaught Place (clubs, pubs), Cyber Hub in Gurugram (microbreweries, cocktail bars), and select venues in South Delhi (Mehrauli, Saket, Defence Colony).

**What to know:**

- Most bars and clubs close by 1:00am (Delhi government regulation). Gurugram venues sometimes push to 2:00am.
- Cover charges at popular clubs run ₹1,000-3,000 ($12-36) per couple on weekends, often redeemable against drinks.
- Craft beer is ₹300-600 ($4-7) per pint at microbreweries.
- Cocktails at upscale bars cost ₹600-1,200 ($7-15).
- Dress codes apply at most clubs — no shorts, no sandals for men.

For specific venues and what to expect, read our [best nightlife in Delhi](/delhi/best-nightlife-in-delhi/) guide.

## How To Choose Your Experience

**If you only have time for one experience:** Book a cooking class. It combines market culture, home hospitality, and food in a single session, and you leave with practical skills.

**If you're an early riser:** Cycling through Old Delhi at dawn is unlike any other city experience.

**If you're into art:** Lodhi Art District in the morning, then Humayun's Tomb in the afternoon — you'll cover modern and Mughal art in a single day.

**If you want something spiritual:** Thursday evening qawwali at Nizamuddin Dargah. Get there early, sit close, and let the music do its work.

**If you want to party:** Start at Hauz Khas Village bars, move to Connaught Place or Gurugram's Cyber Hub.

**If you have kids:** See our guide to [things to do in Delhi with kids](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-with-kids/) — it covers the National Rail Museum, Science Centre, and Lodhi Gardens picnics.
