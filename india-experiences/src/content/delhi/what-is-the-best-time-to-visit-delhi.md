  - question: "What months should I avoid visiting Delhi?"
    answer: "Avoid April through June. Temperatures regularly exceed 43-47 degrees Celsius (110-117F), and the heat makes outdoor sightseeing genuinely dangerous. Even locals avoid being outside between noon and 4 PM. If you must visit in summer, plan indoor activities for the afternoon — museums, malls, or cooking classes."
  - question: "Is Delhi worth visiting during monsoon season?"
    answer: "July through September brings heavy rain, high humidity, and occasional flooding on Delhi's roads. The upside: monument crowds thin out dramatically, hotel prices drop 30-50%, and the city turns green. If you don't mind getting wet and carry an umbrella, monsoon Delhi has a moody, atmospheric quality that some travellers love."
  - question: "When is Delhi least crowded for tourists?"
    answer: "July through September (monsoon) and April through June (extreme heat) see the fewest international tourists. Among the popular months, February and early March are slightly less crowded than the November-January peak. Weekday visits to major monuments are always less crowded than weekends regardless of season."

**October to March is the best time to visit Delhi, with daytime temperatures between 10 and 28 degrees Celsius and mostly dry skies.** This six-month window covers Delhi's autumn, winter, and early spring — the only seasons when outdoor sightseeing is genuinely comfortable.

Delhi has one of the most extreme climates of any major tourist city. The difference between the best and worst months to visit is the difference between a 20-degree February afternoon and a 47-degree June inferno. Getting the timing right fundamentally changes your experience.

## Season-by-Season Breakdown

### October-November: The Post-Monsoon Sweet Spot

**Temperature**: 15-32 degrees C (59-90F)
**Rainfall**: Minimal
**Crowds**: Building towards peak season

October is when Delhi starts feeling liveable again after the monsoon. The rain has washed the dust off the buildings, the parks are green, and the air is the cleanest it will be all year (before winter pollution arrives in late November).

**Diwali** falls in October or November and transforms the city — markets overflow with sweets, homes light up with diyas (oil lamps), and fireworks fill the sky for days. It's one of the most atmospheric times to visit, though accommodation prices spike.

Late November brings the start of Delhi's winter pollution season. From roughly November 15 onwards, crop stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana combines with cold, still air to push pollution levels up sharply. This doesn't ruin the experience for most visitors, but it's noticeable — grey skies, reduced visibility, and a slight haze.

### December-January: Peak Tourist Season

**Temperature**: 4-20 degrees C (39-68F)
**Rainfall**: Almost none
**Crowds**: Highest of the year

December and January are Delhi's coldest months. Mornings can drop to 3-5 degrees C, and fog sometimes delays flights and trains. By midday, temperatures rise to a pleasant 15-20 degrees.

This is peak season for a reason: the weather is comfortable for walking, the light is beautiful for photography (warm and low-angled), and the monument crowds, while large, are manageable with early starts.

**Pollution warning**: December and January see Delhi's worst air quality. The Air Quality Index regularly exceeds 300 (classified as "hazardous"). Sensitive travellers should bring N95 masks and plan indoor alternatives for heavily polluted days.

**Republic Day** (January 26) features India's biggest military parade along Kartavya Path. Spectacular to watch but security restrictions close large sections of central Delhi for days beforehand.

### February-March: The Ideal Window

**Temperature**: 8-27 degrees C (46-81F)
**Rainfall**: Occasional light rain
**Crowds**: Moderate

February is arguably Delhi's best single month. Pollution has eased, temperatures are mild, and the city's flowering trees — especially the gulmohar and amaltas — start blooming. The air clarity improves dramatically compared to December-January.

March is comfortable through mid-month, but temperatures start climbing in the second half. By late March, afternoons hit 30-33 degrees C and you can feel summer approaching. March also brings **Holi**, the festival of colours, typically in mid-March — a chaotic, joyful experience if you want to participate.

### April-June: The Furnace

**Temperature**: 32-47 degrees C (90-117F)
**Rainfall**: Almost none until late June
**Crowds**: Minimal

This is the season to avoid. Delhi's summer heat is not a mild inconvenience — it's physically dangerous. Temperatures above 45 degrees C are common in May and June. The government issues heat stroke advisories. Streets empty between noon and 4 PM.

If you must visit during summer, restructure your day: sightsee from sunrise until 10 AM, spend the afternoon in air-conditioned spaces (National Museum, malls, cooking classes), and come back out after 5 PM. Drink at least 3-4 litres of water daily.

Hotel prices drop significantly — you can find 5-star rooms at 40-60% off peak season rates. Flights are cheaper too.

### July-September: The Monsoon

**Temperature**: 25-35 degrees C (77-95F)
**Rainfall**: Heavy, intermittent
**Crowds**: Low

Delhi's monsoon typically arrives in late June or early July and continues through September. Rain falls in heavy bursts rather than constant drizzle — you might get two hours of torrential rain followed by sunshine.

The city has drainage issues, and low-lying areas flood during heavy rains. Road traffic becomes chaotic. But the upside is real: temperatures drop 10-15 degrees from the summer peaks, everything turns green, and the monuments look dramatic against dark monsoon skies.

Humayun's Tomb gardens in the rain. Lodhi Gardens with wet trees and peacocks. Old Delhi's lanes with steam rising from food stalls. If you're a photographer, monsoon Delhi has a quality of light you won't find in any other season.

## What to Pack Based on Season

Packing for Delhi depends entirely on when you go. Winter visitors need warm layers for morning fog and cold monuments. Summer visitors need sun protection and loose breathable clothing. Monsoon visitors need waterproof bags and shoes that can handle wet streets.

## What Months Should I Avoid Visiting Delhi?

Avoid April through June. Temperatures regularly exceed 43-47 degrees Celsius (110-117F), and the heat makes outdoor sightseeing genuinely dangerous. Even locals avoid being outside between noon and 4 PM. If you must visit in summer, plan indoor activities for the afternoon — museums, malls, or cooking classes.

## Is Delhi Worth Visiting During Monsoon Season?

July through September brings heavy rain, high humidity, and occasional flooding on Delhi's roads. The upside: monument crowds thin out dramatically, hotel prices drop 30-50%, and the city turns green. If you don't mind getting wet and carry an umbrella, monsoon Delhi has a moody, atmospheric quality that some travellers love.

## When Is Delhi Least Crowded for Tourists?

July through September (monsoon) and April through June (extreme heat) see the fewest international tourists. Among the popular months, February and early March are slightly less crowded than the November-January peak. Weekday visits to major monuments are always less crowded than weekends regardless of season.
