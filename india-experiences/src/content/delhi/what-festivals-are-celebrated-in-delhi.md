**Delhi celebrates more festivals than almost any other city in the world — over 30 major ones each year — thanks to its position as India's capital and the extraordinary religious and cultural diversity of its 20+ million residents.** No matter when you visit, something is likely happening.

The city marks Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, and Jain festivals alongside secular national celebrations. For travellers, this means your trip timing can coincide with anything from a quiet neighbourhood prayer gathering to a city-wide explosion of colour, light, and sound.

## The Major Festivals: A Calendar

### January

**Lohri (13 January)** — A Punjabi harvest festival celebrated with bonfires, folk music, and dance. Since Delhi has a massive Punjabi population, Lohri is widely observed across the city. Families and communities gather around bonfires, toss popcorn and peanuts into the fire, and perform bhangra. Hotels and residential colonies often host their own Lohri events. Tourist-friendly and easy to stumble into.

**Republic Day (26 January)** — India's biggest national celebration. A military parade rolls down Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath) with tanks, missile launchers, fighter jet flyovers, and cultural tableaux from every Indian state. Tickets are available online through the government portal, and you need to arrive by 7:00 AM. Read our full guide on [Republic Day in Delhi](/delhi/what-happens-on-republic-day-in-delhi/) for ticket details and what to expect.

### February

**Surajkund International Crafts Mela (1-15 February, approximately)** — A two-week crafts fair held in Faridabad, 30 minutes from Delhi. Artisans from all Indian states and a dozen partner countries sell handicrafts, textiles, and pottery. Food stalls serve regional dishes. Entry is around ₹180 ($2.15). See our full guide on [Surajkund Mela](/delhi/what-is-surajkund-mela/) for transport and tips.

**Basant Panchami (late January or early February)** — Marks the arrival of spring. People wear yellow clothes, fly kites, and visit Saraswati temples. Low-key but visually beautiful.

### March

**Holi (mid-March, date varies annually)** — The festival of colours. People drench each other in coloured powder and water. Delhi goes completely wild. For tourists, organised [Holi events at hotels](/delhi/where-to-celebrate-holi-in-delhi/) are safer than joining random street celebrations. An extraordinary experience if you prepare properly.

### April-May

**Baisakhi (13 or 14 April)** — The Sikh new year, celebrated enthusiastically at Delhi's gurdwaras, especially Bangla Sahib. Free communal meals (langar), live kirtan music, and processions.

**Buddha Purnima (May, full moon)** — Commemorates the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and death. Celebrations at Ladakh Buddhist Vihara in central Delhi and at the Buddha Jayanti Park near the Ridge.

### June-July

**Eid-ul-Fitr (date varies, follows Ramadan)** — The end of the holy month of Ramadan. Jama Masjid in Old Delhi becomes the centre of celebrations. Thousands gather for morning prayers, then the surrounding lanes fill with feasting. The food around Jama Masjid during Eid is exceptional — biryani, kebabs, sheer khurma, and sewaiyan spill out of every shop. Tourists are welcome to watch the prayers from a respectful distance and eat in the surrounding lanes.

**Eid-ul-Adha (date varies)** — A second major Islamic festival, marked with prayers and feasts. Old Delhi is the focal point again.

### August

**Independence Day (15 August)** — The Prime Minister hoists the flag at Red Fort and delivers a nationally televised speech. The ceremony is by invitation only, but you can watch it on screens near India Gate. Security is extremely tight across central Delhi.

**Raksha Bandhan (August, date varies)** — Sisters tie thread bracelets (rakhis) on brothers' wrists. A family-focused celebration. Markets sell elaborate rakhis in the weeks leading up.

**Janmashtami (August/September, date varies)** — Lord Krishna's birthday. Temples across Delhi hold midnight celebrations, dramatic re-enactments of Krishna's life (Ras Leela), and the famous dahi handi (human pyramid) competitions. ISKCON Temple in East of Kailash is the biggest celebration point.

### October

**Dussehra/Vijayadashami (October, date varies)** — The victory of good over evil. Giant effigies of the demon king Ravana — some towering 30 metres — are stuffed with firecrackers and burned at dusk across Delhi's parks and grounds. The Ramlila grounds near Red Fort host elaborate theatrical performances for weeks before Dussehra. The burning at the main Ramlila Maidan is attended by the President of India. Entry to most Ramlila performances is free.

### October-November

**Diwali (October/November, date varies)** — The festival of lights and Delhi's most spectacular celebration. Markets are decorated with lights, homes glow with oil lamps and candles, fireworks explode across the skyline, and sweets are exchanged. It's also the loudest festival — firecrackers go off for days. Read our detailed guide on [Diwali in Delhi](/delhi/diwali-in-delhi-what-to-expect/) for what to expect, including air quality warnings.

### November

**Guru Nanak Jayanti (November, date varies)** — The birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. Processions (nagar kirtans) wind through Delhi's streets, and gurdwaras serve free meals to thousands. Bangla Sahib Gurdwara near Connaught Place is the centrepiece.

### December

**Christmas (25 December)** — Delhi's Christian community celebrates with services at historic churches like Sacred Heart Cathedral and St. James' Church. Connaught Place, Select Citywalk mall, and Khan Market put up decorations. Hotels host Christmas brunches. It's a pleasant time to be in Delhi — cool weather, festive markets, and a relaxed atmosphere.

## Which Festivals Are Best for Tourists?

Not all festivals are equally accessible to visitors. Here's a quick ranking:

**Most tourist-friendly**: Republic Day parade, Surajkund Mela, Christmas, Dussehra effigy burnings — all are easy to attend, safe, and visually stunning.

**Amazing but requires preparation**: Diwali (bring an N95 mask for air quality), Holi (go to an organised event, not the streets), Eid at Jama Masjid (go early, respect the prayers, then enjoy the food).

**Best for cultural immersion**: Janmashtami temple visits, Guru Nanak Jayanti langar meals, Baisakhi at Bangla Sahib — these let you participate in genuinely spiritual moments.
