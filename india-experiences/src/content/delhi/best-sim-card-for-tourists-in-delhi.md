  - question: "Which SIM card should I get in Delhi?"
    answer: "Airtel or Jio — both have good 4G/5G coverage across Delhi. Airtel has slightly better customer service in English and more airport counters. Jio is marginally cheaper and has strong data speeds. Avoid Vodafone-Idea (Vi) as its network coverage has been unreliable. Buy your SIM at the airport arrival hall for the smoothest experience."
  - question: "How long does a tourist SIM take to activate in India?"
    answer: "Officially 2-24 hours, though most airport-purchased SIMs activate within 2-4 hours. City shop SIMs can take up to 24 hours. You'll get a text confirmation when your number goes live. Until then, use your hotel's WiFi. Some airport counters now offer instant-activation tourist SIMs for a small premium."
  - question: "Do I need a local SIM card in Delhi?"
    answer: "Strongly recommended. You need an Indian number to book Uber and Ola, receive OTPs for UPI payments, and make local calls. Delhi has decent free WiFi at Metro stations and some cafes, but it's unreliable. A local SIM with 1.5-2 GB daily data costs just ₹500-700 for a month."

**Get an Airtel or Jio SIM at Delhi airport's arrival hall for ₹500-700 ($6-8.50) — it includes 1.5-2 GB daily data for 28 days and is the single most useful thing you can buy when you land.** You'll need your passport, a passport-sized photo, and a photocopy of your passport and visa. Activation takes 2-24 hours.

Without a local SIM, you can't book Uber or Ola (they need an Indian number for OTP), you can't use UPI payments, and you're dependent on spotty hotel WiFi. Get this sorted first.

## Where To Buy

### At the Airport (Best Option)

IGI Airport Terminal 3 has Airtel and Jio counters in the arrivals hall, past customs but before the exit doors. Terminal 1 has fewer options but usually has at least one counter open.

**Airport advantages:**
- Staff are used to processing tourist SIMs
- They have passport photo and photocopy facilities on-site
- English-speaking staff
- Some counters offer instant or near-instant activation

The counters are open for most arriving flights, including late-night ones. If you land at an odd hour and the counters are closed, head to your hotel and pick up a SIM the next morning — your hotel front desk can usually point you to the nearest shop.

Before you leave the airport, also check our guide on [getting from Delhi airport to the city](/delhi/how-do-i-get-from-delhi-airport-to-the-city/) to sort your transport.

### In the City

Any authorised Airtel or Jio store can sell you a tourist SIM. Useful locations:

- **Connaught Place** — multiple Airtel and Jio stores along the inner and outer circle
- **Khan Market** — small phone shops near the main strip
- **Karol Bagh** — Ajmal Khan Road has several mobile shops

City shops charge the same price but activation can take longer — up to 24 hours in some cases. You'll also need to bring your own passport photocopy and photo, which the airport counters handle for you.

## What You Need

1. **Passport** — original, not a copy
2. **Passport-sized photo** — one is enough. The airport counter can take one if you don't have it
3. **Photocopy of passport and visa page** — airport counters have a photocopier. If buying in the city, make copies at any stationery shop (₹5-10 per page)
4. **Indian address** — your hotel's address works. Just write down the hotel name and address

The process takes 10-15 minutes of paperwork.

## Airtel vs Jio: Which One?

**Airtel** has been in India longer, has more physical stores, and offers better English-language customer support. Their 4G/5G coverage across Delhi is strong. Tourist plans start around ₹599 for 28 days with 1.5 GB daily data plus unlimited calls.

**Jio** is newer, slightly cheaper, and has aggressive data plans. Coverage in Delhi is on par with Airtel, sometimes faster for data speeds. Plans start around ₹499 for 28 days with 2 GB daily data.

**Avoid Vi (Vodafone-Idea).** Their network has deteriorated in recent years, with patchy coverage and slower speeds in many parts of Delhi.

Either Airtel or Jio will serve you well. If you can only find one at the airport counter, take it — the difference is marginal.

## Activation Timeline

- **Airport SIMs:** Usually active within 2-4 hours. Some premium tourist SIMs activate within 30-60 minutes.
- **City shop SIMs:** Can take up to 24 hours.
- **You'll know it's active** when you receive an SMS confirmation and see signal bars on your phone.

Until your SIM activates, use your hotel WiFi. Download any apps you'll need — [Uber and Ola for transport](/delhi/is-uber-available-in-delhi/), Google Maps offline maps for Delhi, and WhatsApp for local communication.

## eSIM Alternative

If your phone supports eSIM (most iPhones from XS onwards, many newer Android phones), you can buy an eSIM online before you fly. Providers like Airalo and Holafly sell India eSIMs for $8-15 for 7-15 days of data.

**The catch:** eSIMs give you data only — no Indian phone number. This means no Uber/Ola bookings, no OTPs, and no local calls. An eSIM works as a backup or if you really only need data for maps and messaging, but a physical SIM is far more useful for day-to-day travel in Delhi.

## Topping Up

Both Airtel and Jio have apps where you can recharge your plan using an international credit card. You can also recharge at any of the thousands of small shops displaying the carrier's logo — just tell them your number and the amount. Minimum recharge is usually ₹10-20.

If you need a [visa for India](/delhi/do-i-need-a-visa-for-india/), sort that before worrying about SIM cards — you'll need the e-visa confirmation when you land.

## Which SIM Card Should I Get in Delhi?

Airtel or Jio — both have good 4G/5G coverage across Delhi. Airtel has slightly better customer service in English and more airport counters. Jio is marginally cheaper and has strong data speeds. Avoid Vodafone-Idea (Vi) as its network coverage has been unreliable. Buy your SIM at the airport arrival hall for the smoothest experience.

## How Long Does a Tourist SIM Take to Activate in India?

Officially 2-24 hours, though most airport-purchased SIMs activate within 2-4 hours. City shop SIMs can take up to 24 hours. You'll get a text confirmation when your number goes live. Until then, use your hotel's WiFi. Some airport counters now offer instant-activation tourist SIMs for a small premium.

## Do I Need a Local SIM Card in Delhi?

Strongly recommended. You need an Indian number to book Uber and Ola, receive OTPs for UPI payments, and make local calls. Delhi has decent free WiFi at Metro stations and some cafes, but it's unreliable. A local SIM with 1.5-2 GB daily data costs just ₹500-700 for a month.
