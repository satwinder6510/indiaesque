  - question: "What are the best souvenirs to buy in Delhi?"
    answer: "The best Delhi souvenirs are whole spices from Khari Baoli (₹100-500 per bag), pashmina or silk scarves, Rajasthani miniature paintings, brass and copperware, Ayurvedic skincare from Forest Essentials or Kama Ayurveda, and loose-leaf Indian tea. These are lightweight, packable, and genuinely Indian — not mass-produced tourist trinkets."
  - question: "Where is the cheapest place to buy souvenirs in Delhi?"
    answer: "Janpath Market near Connaught Place has the lowest starting prices for scarves, jewellery, and small gifts, though you need to bargain. Dilli Haat is slightly pricier but the quality is higher and you're buying directly from artisans. For spices, Khari Baoli in Old Delhi is the cheapest by far — a fraction of supermarket prices."
  - question: "Is it safe to buy spices in Delhi markets?"
    answer: "Yes, if you buy from established shops in Khari Baoli. Look for stalls with high turnover — fresh stock means better quality. Buy whole spices rather than pre-ground powders when possible, as whole spices are harder to adulterate. Vacuum-sealed packets travel better in luggage."

**Spices, textiles, miniature paintings, brassware, Ayurvedic products, and loose-leaf tea are the smartest buys in Delhi — they're lightweight, affordable, and genuinely Indian.** Skip the plastic Taj Mahal models and bring home something people will actually use or display.

## Spices from Khari Baoli

Delhi's best souvenir might be a bag of spices from [Khari Baoli](/delhi/where-to-buy-spices-in-delhi/), Asia's largest spice market in Old Delhi. Whole spices here cost a fraction of what you'd pay at home — 100g of Kashmiri saffron runs ₹300-800 ($3.60-9.60) depending on grade, a bag of whole cardamom is ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80), and cumin or coriander seeds cost almost nothing.

Buy whole spices, not pre-ground. They last longer, taste better, and customs officers are less likely to question them. Ask vendors for vacuum-sealed packets — most shops at Khari Baoli offer this for free.

**Best buys**: Kashmiri saffron, green cardamom, black cardamom, star anise, whole dried red chillies, and garam masala blends.

## Textiles and Scarves

India does textiles better than almost anywhere on earth, and Delhi concentrates the best of every region. You can find Kashmiri pashmina shawls, Rajasthani block-printed cotton, Banarasi silk, and Lucknowi chikankari embroidery all in one city.

**Where to buy**: Dilli Haat for regional textiles at fair prices. Fabindia in Khan Market or Greater Kailash for contemporary Indian cotton and silk clothing. Chandni Chowk's Kinari Bazaar for raw fabrics and wedding textiles. The Central Cottage Industries Emporium on Japath Road (government-run, fixed prices) is reliable for quality-checked items.

**Price range**: Cotton scarves from ₹200-500 ($2.40-6). Silk scarves from ₹800-2,000 ($9.60-24). Pashmina shawls from ₹2,000-15,000 ($24-180) depending on purity — real pashmina should pass through a ring.

## Miniature Paintings

Rajasthani and Mughal-style miniature paintings are one of Delhi's most distinctive souvenirs. These detailed paintings on paper, silk, or old manuscript pages depict court scenes, hunting parties, gods, and nature scenes using natural pigments and fine brushwork.

**Where to buy**: Dilli Haat has artisan stalls with paintings starting at ₹500-2,000 ($6-24) for smaller pieces. The shops around Janpath and Connaught Place sell them too, but quality varies — hold the painting up to light to check if the detail work is genuinely hand-painted (you'll see slight irregularities) versus printed.

For gallery-quality work, visit the shops in Hauz Khas Village or the Crafts Museum gift shop near Pragati Maidan.

## Brass and Copperware

Brass chai glasses, copper water bottles, engraved plates, and small decorative items are durable, distinctive, and surprisingly affordable. The brass lane in Chandni Chowk (near Dariba Kalan) has the widest selection.

**Price range**: Small brass items from ₹200-500 ($2.40-6). Engraved copper water bottles from ₹600-1,500 ($7-18). Decorative plates from ₹500-3,000 ($6-36).

Copper water bottles have become popular globally — you'll find them everywhere from Chandni Chowk to airport shops, but market prices are about one-third of what you'd pay at the airport.

## Ayurvedic Products

Two Indian brands — **Forest Essentials** and **Kama Ayurveda** — make high-end Ayurvedic skincare, haircare, and body products that are significantly cheaper in India than abroad. A Forest Essentials facial serum that sells for $80-100 overseas costs ₹2,500-3,500 ($30-42) here.

**Where to buy**: Both brands have standalone stores in Khan Market, Select Citywalk Mall (Saket), and DLF Promenade (Vasant Kunj). Kama Ayurveda also has a beautiful store in the Meherchand Market area near Lodhi Colony.

For budget-friendly Ayurvedic products, **Patanjali** and **Himalaya** are widely available at pharmacies across Delhi at very low prices — a tube of Himalaya neem face wash costs ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40).

## Tea

India produces some of the world's best tea, and Delhi is a good place to stock up before you fly home. Look for first-flush Darjeeling, Assam second-flush (strong and malty), and Kashmiri kahwa (green tea with saffron, cardamom, and almonds).

**Where to buy**: **Mittal Teas** in Chandni Chowk has been selling loose-leaf tea since 1934. **Aap Ki Pasand** in Old Delhi does tea tastings before you buy. For packaged options, any branch of **Chaayos** sells their blends, or visit the tea section at **Nature's Basket** or **Foodhall** in South Delhi malls.

**Price range**: 100g of good Darjeeling first-flush costs ₹400-1,000 ($4.80-12). Assam CTC for daily chai runs ₹100-300 ($1.20-3.60) for 250g. Kashmiri kahwa costs ₹200-500 ($2.40-6) for 100g.
