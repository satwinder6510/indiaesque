  - question: "Can you visit all seven cities of Delhi in one day?"
    answer: "You can visit five of the seven in a day with a hired car and an early start. Lal Kot/Mehrauli, Siri, Jahanpanah, Firozabad, and Shahjahanabad are all within the city and accessible by road. Tughlaqabad requires a detour to Delhi's southeastern edge — add it if time allows. Dinpanah/Purana Qila is central and easy to include. Budget 8-10 hours for a full seven-cities tour."
  - question: "Which is the oldest city of Delhi?"
    answer: "Lal Kot, built by the Tomar Rajputs around 1060 AD, is the oldest of the traditional seven cities. However, Delhi's habitation goes back much further — excavations at Purana Qila have found pottery from around 1000 BC, suggesting the area near the sixth city (Dinpanah) may have been settled over 3,000 years ago."
  - question: "Why did Delhi keep getting rebuilt?"
    answer: "Each new dynasty wanted its own capital, and Delhi's strategic location at the gateway to the Indo-Gangetic Plain made it the obvious site. Rulers also built new cities for practical reasons — old cities became overcrowded, water sources dried up, or invading armies destroyed what existed. Building fresh was often easier than rebuilding, especially with cheap labour and abundant stone from the Aravalli Hills."

**The seven cities of Delhi are Lal Kot, Siri, Tughlaqabad, Jahanpanah, Firozabad, Dinpanah/Shergarh, and Shahjahanabad — each built by a different dynasty between 1060 and 1638 AD.** The ruins of all seven still exist across modern Delhi, and you can trace nearly 600 years of power struggles through their remains.

## 1. Lal Kot and Qila Rai Pithora (1060-1180s)

**Location:** Mehrauli, South Delhi

The Tomar Rajputs built Lal Kot around 1060 AD, making it the earliest of the seven traditional cities. When Prithviraj Chauhan defeated the Tomars in the 1180s, he expanded the fortifications and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.

After Muhammad of Ghor defeated Prithviraj in 1192, his general Qutub-ud-din Aibak established the Delhi Sultanate and built the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque and the Qutub Minar on this site — using pillars from the destroyed Hindu and Jain temples.

**What survives:** The Qutub Minar complex is the main draw. Fragments of Lal Kot's walls are visible in the [Mehrauli Archaeological Park](/delhi/what-is-mehrauli-archaeological-park/) adjacent to the Qutub complex. The park has over 200 structures spanning ten centuries.

## 2. Siri (1303)

**Location:** Between Hauz Khas and Panchsheel Park, South Delhi

Sultan Alauddin Khalji built Siri after repelling a Mongol invasion. The fortified city was his power base, and he constructed the massive Hauz Khas reservoir (still a lake today) to supply it with water. He also began the Alai Minar near Qutub Minar — intended to be twice as tall — but abandoned it after his death.

**What survives:** Fragments of Siri's walls run through the area near Siri Fort Auditorium. The Hauz Khas complex — a madrasa and tomb overlooking the lake — was built by Firoz Shah Tughlaq in the 14th century and is now surrounded by the Hauz Khas Village restaurant and bar district. You can walk along the ruins for free.

## 3. Tughlaqabad (1321)

**Location:** Southeastern Delhi, near Faridabad border

Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq built this imposing fortress city in just four years. The massive stone walls, some 15 metres high, enclose a huge area that was meant to be the grandest city in the Sultanate. It lasted barely five years. According to legend, a Sufi saint cursed the city after a dispute with Tughlaq, declaring it would be inhabited only by jackals. Water shortages and the sultan's death in 1325 made the prophecy self-fulfilling.

**What survives:** The enormous ruined walls and bastions are among Delhi's most dramatic sights. Ghiyasuddin's tomb sits on a small island in what was once an artificial lake, connected by a causeway. Entry is ₹35 ($0.40) for Indians, ₹300 ($3.60) for foreigners. The site is isolated — take a cab from Tughlaqabad metro station (Violet Line), about 3 km.

## 4. Jahanpanah (1326-1327)

**Location:** Between Siri and Lal Kot, around Panchsheel Park and Chirag Delhi

Muhammad bin Tughlaq — arguably Delhi's most eccentric ruler — built Jahanpanah ("Refuge of the World") to connect the two earlier cities of Siri and Lal Kot. He also famously moved the entire capital to Daulatabad in Maharashtra (1,100 km south), then moved it back when the plan predictably failed.

**What survives:** Bijay Mandal, believed to be Muhammad bin Tughlaq's palace, stands in a residential neighbourhood behind the Panchsheel Club. The Begumpuri Mosque, one of the largest in Delhi, is nearby in Begumpur village — it's a stunning seven-arched structure that almost nobody visits. Both are free to enter.

## 5. Firozabad (1354)

**Location:** Along the Yamuna, near ITO and Pragati Maidan

Firoz Shah Tughlaq built his city along the river, centred on a citadel that contained palaces, mosques, and a 3rd-century BC Ashokan pillar that he had transported from Ambala in Punjab. Moving a 13-metre stone pillar across 200 km in the 14th century was a remarkable engineering feat.

**What survives:** Feroz Shah Kotla (the citadel ruins) is near the Delhi and District Cricket Association stadium on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg. The Ashokan pillar still stands on the upper level. The site also has a reputation among locals as a place where djinns (spirits) gather — you'll see incense and offerings left in the chambers on Thursdays. Entry is ₹35/₹300. Nearest metro: ITO (Violet Line).

## 6. Dinpanah and Shergarh (1533-1545)

**Location:** Near Pragati Maidan, central Delhi

Mughal Emperor Humayun founded Dinpanah ("Refuge of Faith") in 1533 on the banks of the Yamuna. But he was overthrown by Sher Shah Suri in 1540, who demolished parts of the city and rebuilt it as Shergarh. Humayun recaptured it in 1555 but died the following year after falling down the stairs of his library here.

**What survives:** Purana Qila (Old Fort) is one of Delhi's best-preserved fortifications. The Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque inside is a fine example of Indo-Afghan architecture. The Sher Mandal, the octagonal tower where Humayun died, is also inside the complex. Archaeological excavations have found layers going back to 1000 BC, suggesting this may be the site of Indraprastha from the Mahabharata. Entry is ₹35/₹300.

## 7. Shahjahanabad (1638)

**Location:** Old Delhi

Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor who also built the Taj Mahal, moved his capital from Agra to Delhi in 1638 and built his new city over the next decade. Shahjahanabad was centred on the Red Fort (Lal Qila) and the Jama Masjid, with Chandni Chowk as its main commercial street. The city was surrounded by walls with 14 gates, several of which — Kashmere Gate, Ajmeri Gate, Delhi Gate, Turkman Gate — still stand.

**What survives:** Old Delhi is Shahjahanabad. The Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and Chandni Chowk are all part of this seventh city. Unlike the other six, Shahjahanabad is a living, breathing, densely packed neighbourhood — approximately 100,000 people still live within the old walled city. Explore it with a [heritage walk](/delhi/heritage-walks/) for the full picture.

## Visiting the Seven Cities

The most logical route starts south and moves north, roughly chronological:

**Morning:** Mehrauli (Lal Kot) and Qutub Minar complex. Walk through the archaeological park. Then Siri Fort area and Hauz Khas.

**Midday:** Jahanpanah — Bijay Mandal and Begumpuri Mosque. Then Firozabad — Feroz Shah Kotla.

**Afternoon:** Purana Qila (Dinpanah/Shergarh). End at Shahjahanabad — Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk for sunset.

**Optional detour:** Tughlaqabad, on the southeastern fringe, is best visited separately or added between Mehrauli and the Siri area.

For the full picture of [how old Delhi really is](/delhi/how-old-is-delhi/), remember that these seven cities represent only the last millennium. Human settlement here goes back at least 3,000 years.

## Can You Visit All Seven Cities of Delhi in One Day?

You can visit five of the seven in a day with a hired car and an early start. Lal Kot/Mehrauli, Siri, Jahanpanah, Firozabad, and Shahjahanabad are all within the city and accessible by road. Tughlaqabad requires a detour to Delhi's southeastern edge — add it if time allows. Dinpanah/Purana Qila is central and easy to include. Budget 8-10 hours for a full seven-cities tour.

## Which Is the Oldest City of Delhi?

Lal Kot, built by the Tomar Rajputs around 1060 AD, is the oldest of the traditional seven cities. However, Delhi's habitation goes back much further — excavations at Purana Qila have found pottery from around 1000 BC, suggesting the area near the sixth city (Dinpanah) may have been settled over 3,000 years ago.

## Why Did Delhi Keep Getting Rebuilt?

Each new dynasty wanted its own capital, and Delhi's strategic location at the gateway to the Indo-Gangetic Plain made it the obvious site. Rulers also built new cities for practical reasons — old cities became overcrowded, water sources dried up, or invading armies destroyed what existed. Building fresh was often easier than rebuilding, especially with cheap labour and abundant stone from the Aravalli Hills.
