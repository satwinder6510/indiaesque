  - question: "What precautions should solo female travellers take in Delhi?"
    answer: "Use the women-only carriage at the front of every metro train. Book Uber or Ola instead of hailing street autos, especially after dark. Share your live trip location with someone you trust. Stay in well-reviewed hotels in central areas like Connaught Place, Hauz Khas, or Defence Colony. Avoid empty streets and parks after dark. Keep the women's helpline number saved: 1091."
  - question: "Is the Delhi Metro safe for women?"
    answer: "Yes, the Delhi Metro is one of the safest spaces in the city for women. Every train has a dedicated women's carriage at the front, marked in pink. Stations have CCTV coverage, security screening at every entrance, and regular police patrols. During rush hour (8-10 AM and 5-7 PM), the women's carriage can get crowded, but it remains a comfortable option."
  - question: "What areas in Delhi are safest for solo female travellers?"
    answer: "South Delhi neighbourhoods like Hauz Khas, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Lodhi Colony, and Vasant Vihar are the safest for solo women. Connaught Place inner circle and Khan Market are well-patrolled and busy until late. For accommodation, areas near diplomatic enclaves (Chanakyapuri) and south-central Delhi provide the most comfortable experience."

**Delhi is safe for solo female travellers who take standard precautions, particularly around transport and neighbourhood choices.** Thousands of women travel solo in Delhi every year — including Indian women living and commuting alone daily. The city has specific infrastructure designed for women's safety, and knowing how to use it makes a real difference.

That said, it's worth being direct: Delhi has a reputation, and some of it is earned. Unwanted attention — staring, comments, and occasional harassment — happens more frequently here than in cities like Mumbai or Bangalore. The key is knowing which tools exist to minimise discomfort and which areas give you the most freedom.

## Transport: Your Most Important Safety Decision

How you get around Delhi determines most of your safety experience. The right transport choices eliminate the majority of risk.

### The Delhi Metro: Your Best Friend

The metro is the safest way to move around the city. Every train has a **women-only carriage** at the front, clearly marked in pink signage. It's enforced — men who enter are fined and removed. During off-peak hours, these carriages are spacious and comfortable. During rush hour, they're crowded but still women-only.

Every metro station has **bag scanning and metal detectors** at entry. CCTV cameras cover platforms and trains. Female security staff are present at most major stations.

The metro runs from approximately 6 AM to 11 PM. Plan your travel to use it during operating hours whenever possible. For detailed route planning, see our [Delhi Metro guide](/delhi/how-to-use-delhi-metro/).

### Uber and Ola: Essential After Dark

After 9 PM, always use **Uber or Ola** rather than hailing a street auto-rickshaw. Both apps provide:

- **Driver details** (name, photo, vehicle number) before you get in
- **Live trip tracking** that you can share with contacts
- **An SOS button** that alerts emergency services with your GPS location
- **A digital record** of every trip

Uber has a **"Share My Trip"** feature — turn it on and send the live link to someone you trust. Ola has a similar function. Use it every time you ride at night.

If you need to take an auto-rickshaw during the day, use **Uber Auto** or **Ola Auto** through the app rather than negotiating with street autos. The ride is tracked and metered.

### Pre-Paid Taxis from the Airport

At **IGI Airport** (Terminal 3 and Terminal 1), use the official pre-paid taxi booth inside the arrivals hall. You pay a fixed fare at the counter, receive a receipt, and the driver's details are logged. Alternatively, book an Uber or Ola from the designated pickup zone. Never accept rides from touts in the arrivals hall.

## Where to Stay

Your neighbourhood choice matters. The safest and most comfortable areas for solo female travellers:

**Connaught Place / Janpath**: Central, well-lit, busy at all hours. Walking distance to metro, restaurants, and shops. Hotels range from budget to luxury. The inner circle of CP is safe for evening walks.

**Hauz Khas**: Popular with young professionals and expats. The village area has cafes and restaurants open until 11 PM. Well-connected by metro (Green Line, Hauz Khas station).

**Defence Colony / Lajpat Nagar**: Residential, safe, with good food options. Defence Colony market has restaurants and shops within walking distance.

**Greater Kailash / Saket**: South Delhi residential areas near Select Citywalk mall (a good landmark for orientation and safe meeting point). Well-served by metro.

**Chanakyapuri**: The diplomatic enclave — very safe, very quiet. Limited nightlife but good for a peaceful base. High-end hotels here.

**Areas to avoid for accommodation:** Paharganj (budget backpacker area — safe enough but chaotic and uncomfortable for solo women at night), areas near railway stations, and any neighbourhood far from a metro station.

## Day-to-Day Safety Tips

### Dressing

Delhi is conservative by Western standards but not rigid about it. In tourist areas and South Delhi, you'll see local women in everything from jeans and t-shirts to traditional salwar kameez. Practical guidelines:

- Cover shoulders and knees when visiting temples, mosques, and gurudwaras
- In Old Delhi and Chandni Chowk, more conservative clothing draws less attention
- In South Delhi, Khan Market, and Connaught Place, dress as you would in any city
- Carry a light scarf or shawl — useful for both cultural sites and as an impromptu cover-up

### At Monuments and Tourist Sites

Major monuments (Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar) are well-policed and safe. Tourist police in khaki uniforms are stationed at most sites. If anyone bothers you, approach the nearest police officer or ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) guard.

Be cautious of men asking to take your photo or offering to photograph you. A polite "no, thank you" is sufficient. If someone persists, walk towards a guard or a group of people.

### In Markets and Crowded Areas

**Chandni Chowk** and other old city markets get extremely crowded. Wear a cross-body bag with the flap facing your body. Keep your phone in a front pocket or inside your bag, not in your hand. Walk with purpose — projecting confidence reduces unwanted attention.

If you're shopping in markets where bargaining is expected, being firm on price is completely normal and expected. Shopkeepers may be pushy but they're not threatening.

### Eating Alone

Delhi has a strong cafe culture, and solo women eating alone is common in South Delhi and central Delhi. **Khan Market, Hauz Khas Village, Connaught Place**, and Defence Colony all have plenty of restaurants and cafes where you'll see women dining solo. In Old Delhi, food stalls are standing-room affairs and gender is less noticeable.

### At Night

Stick to busy, well-lit areas after dark. Connaught Place inner circle, Khan Market, and Hauz Khas Village are all fine for evening dining. For bars and nightlife, Delhi's better venues (Kitty Su, Aer, PCO) have strict entry policies and security.

Don't walk through parks, poorly lit residential streets, or construction areas at night. For late nights, always use Uber or Ola — never walk home alone after 11 PM.

For specific nighttime safety information, see our guide on [Delhi safety at night](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-at-night/).

## Emergency Resources

Save these numbers in your phone before you arrive:

- **Women's Helpline**: 1091 (Delhi Police, 24/7)
- **Police**: 100
- **Himmat App**: Delhi Police's safety app for women — sends your location to the nearest patrol car with one tap (download before your trip)
- **Tourist Helpline**: 1363
- **Ambulance**: 102

Your hotel front desk can also assist in any emergency. Choose a hotel with 24-hour reception.

## The Honest Picture

Solo female travel in Delhi requires more awareness than in Southeast Asian cities or Europe. You'll likely experience some staring, and occasionally someone will make an unwelcome comment. These incidents are annoying but rarely escalate.

The flip side: Delhi also has some of India's strongest women's safety infrastructure — dedicated metro carriages, police helplines, app-based transport tracking, and an increasingly vocal culture around women's safety. The city is not perfect, but it's far better equipped than its reputation suggests.

Women who've travelled solo in Delhi consistently say the same thing: the anticipation was worse than the reality. Stay aware, use the tools available, and you'll have a trip defined by the food, history, and culture rather than by safety concerns.

## What Precautions Should Solo Female Travellers Take in Delhi?

Use the women-only carriage at the front of every metro train. Book Uber or Ola instead of hailing street autos, especially after dark. Share your live trip location with someone you trust. Stay in well-reviewed hotels in central areas like Connaught Place, Hauz Khas, or Defence Colony. Avoid empty streets and parks after dark. Keep the women's helpline number saved: 1091.

## Is the Delhi Metro Safe for Women?

Yes, the Delhi Metro is one of the safest spaces in the city for women. Every train has a dedicated women's carriage at the front, marked in pink. Stations have CCTV coverage, security screening at every entrance, and regular police patrols. During rush hour (8-10 AM and 5-7 PM), the women's carriage can get crowded, but it remains a comfortable option.

## What Areas in Delhi Are Safest for Solo Female Travellers?

South Delhi neighbourhoods like Hauz Khas, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Lodhi Colony, and Vasant Vihar are the safest for solo women. Connaught Place inner circle and Khan Market are well-patrolled and busy until late. For accommodation, areas near diplomatic enclaves (Chanakyapuri) and south-central Delhi provide the most comfortable experience.
