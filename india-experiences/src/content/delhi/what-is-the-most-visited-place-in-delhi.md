  - question: "What is the number one tourist attraction in Delhi?"
    answer: "Red Fort (Lal Qila) is Delhi's most visited monument, drawing over 3 million visitors per year. The 17th-century Mughal fortress in Old Delhi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and India's most iconic political symbol — the Prime Minister addresses the nation from its ramparts every Independence Day."
  - question: "Which Delhi monuments are UNESCO World Heritage Sites?"
    answer: "Delhi has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Red Fort (inscribed 2007), Humayun's Tomb (inscribed 1993), and Qutub Minar (inscribed 1993). All three are maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India. Humayun's Tomb has undergone major restoration by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture."
  - question: "Is India Gate the most visited place in Delhi?"
    answer: "India Gate is the most visited open-access site in Delhi since there's no ticket or entry barrier — millions of people visit the lawns every month. But among ticketed monuments, Red Fort leads. India Gate is a war memorial, not a historical monument, so it doesn't appear in ASI visitor statistics the same way."

**Red Fort is the most visited ticketed monument in Delhi, drawing over 3 million visitors per year according to Archaeological Survey of India figures.** If you count open-access sites, India Gate sees far more foot traffic, but it has no entry gate or ticket counter to measure against.

The answer shifts depending on what you're measuring — ticketed monuments, open public spaces, or religious sites. Here's a breakdown of Delhi's most visited places and what the visitor experience is actually like at each.

## Red Fort (Lal Qila) — Most Visited Monument

Red Fort consistently tops the ASI's list of most-visited monuments in India. The massive sandstone fortress was built by Shah Jahan between 1638 and 1648 as the palace of his new capital, Shahjahanabad.

**Visitor details:**
- **Entry fee**: ₹35 ($0.40) for Indian nationals, ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign visitors
- **Hours**: 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM, closed Mondays
- **Nearest metro**: Lal Qila station (Violet Line) or Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line)
- **Time needed**: 90 minutes to 2 hours

The fort covers 255 acres. The key structures inside are the **Diwan-i-Aam** (public audience hall), **Diwan-i-Khas** (private audience hall with the famous inscription about paradise), **Rang Mahal** (the painted palace), and the **Mumtaz Mahal** museum.

**Peak crowds** hit between 11 AM and 2 PM on weekends and during school holidays. Visit at opening time on a weekday for the best experience. The evening sound-and-light show runs nightly but reviews are mixed.

## Qutub Minar — Most Visited Monument in South Delhi

Qutub Minar is Delhi's second most-visited ASI monument and the most popular site in South Delhi. The 72.5-metre tower was built starting in 1193 by Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate.

**Visitor details:**
- **Entry fee**: ₹35 ($0.40) for Indians, ₹550 ($6.50) for foreigners
- **Hours**: Sunrise to sunset, open daily
- **Nearest metro**: Qutub Minar station (Yellow Line)
- **Time needed**: 60-90 minutes

The complex surrounding the tower is arguably more interesting than the tower itself. The **Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque** was the first mosque built in India after the Islamic conquest. The **Iron Pillar** has resisted corrosion for over 1,600 years. **Alai Minar**, the unfinished stump of what was planned to be a tower twice the height of Qutub Minar, shows the ambition of the Khilji dynasty.

Visitors can no longer climb the tower (banned after a stampede in 1981), but the exterior and surroundings are impressive enough. Go early morning for the best light and smallest crowds.

## India Gate — Most Visited Open-Access Site

India Gate is probably the single place in Delhi where the most humans gather on any given day. The 42-metre sandstone arch on Kartavya Path was designed by Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1931 as a memorial to Indian soldiers killed in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

**Visitor details:**
- **Entry fee**: Free, open 24/7
- **Nearest metro**: Central Secretariat (Yellow/Violet Line), then a 15-minute walk or auto
- **Time needed**: 30-60 minutes

The lawns around India Gate are Delhi's biggest informal gathering space. Every evening, thousands of families spread out on the grass, buy ice cream and chaat from vendors, and watch balloon sellers and street performers.

The recently redesigned **Kartavya Path** (formerly Rajpath) runs from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan and is now a landscaped pedestrian-friendly boulevard. The **National War Memorial**, inaugurated in 2019, sits in the circle near India Gate and is worth a visit for its understated design.

India Gate is best visited at sunset or after dark when the arch is illuminated.

## Humayun's Tomb — The Connoisseur's Favourite

Humayun's Tomb doesn't draw the same raw numbers as Red Fort, but many experienced travellers and architecture enthusiasts rate it higher. The tomb was built in 1570 by Humayun's widow Bega Begum and is the earliest example of Mughal garden tomb architecture.

**Visitor details:**
- **Entry fee**: ₹35 ($0.40) for Indians, ₹550 ($6.50) for foreigners
- **Hours**: Sunrise to sunset, open daily
- **Nearest metro**: JLN Stadium (Violet Line)
- **Time needed**: 60-90 minutes

The **Aga Khan Trust for Culture** restored the tomb and gardens extensively in the 2000s. The result is a complex that feels genuinely maintained rather than just preserved. The surrounding tombs — Isa Khan's octagonal tomb, the Barber's Tomb, the Arab Serai — are often overlooked but worth exploring.

## Other Highly Visited Sites

**Jama Masjid**: India's largest mosque draws both worshippers and tourists. Free entry (₹300 camera fee). The Friday afternoon congregation is one of Delhi's most powerful sights.

**Lotus Temple**: The Baha'i House of Worship in South Delhi draws millions of visitors annually thanks to its striking lotus-shaped architecture. Free entry, but expect long queues on weekends.

**Akshardham Temple**: The massive Hindu temple complex in East Delhi claims over 100 million visitors since opening in 2005. No phones, cameras, or bags allowed inside. Plan at least 3 hours.

**Chandni Chowk**: Not a single "place" but a market street that draws millions of shoppers, food pilgrims, and tourists year-round. A [heritage walk](/delhi/heritage-walks/) through these lanes connects the food, architecture, and history that make Old Delhi tick.

## What Is the Number One Tourist Attraction in Delhi?

Red Fort (Lal Qila) is Delhi's most visited monument, drawing over 3 million visitors per year. The 17th-century Mughal fortress in Old Delhi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and India's most iconic political symbol — the Prime Minister addresses the nation from its ramparts every Independence Day.

## Which Delhi Monuments Are UNESCO World Heritage Sites?

Delhi has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Red Fort (inscribed 2007), Humayun's Tomb (inscribed 1993), and Qutub Minar (inscribed 1993). All three are maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India. Humayun's Tomb has undergone major restoration by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.

## Is India Gate the Most Visited Place in Delhi?

India Gate is the most visited open-access site in Delhi since there's no ticket or entry barrier — millions of people visit the lawns every month. But among ticketed monuments, Red Fort leads. India Gate is a war memorial, not a historical monument, so it doesn't appear in ASI visitor statistics the same way.
