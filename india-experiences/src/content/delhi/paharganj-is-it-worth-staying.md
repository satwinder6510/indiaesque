  - question: "Is Paharganj safe for tourists?"
    answer: "Paharganj is reasonably safe during daylight hours on the main bazaar road, where the density of people and shopkeepers provides a natural layer of security. Petty theft (phone snatching, pickpocketing) is the primary risk. After dark, side lanes become poorly lit and uncomfortable — aggressive touts, stray dogs, and uneven sanitation make wandering inadvisable. Solo women should be extra cautious at night. Stick to your hotel after 9-10 PM if you're staying here. It's not dangerous in the way that crime-ridden neighbourhoods in other cities are, but it's wearing."
  - question: "How much does a hotel cost in Paharganj?"
    answer: "Paharganj has Delhi's cheapest accommodation. Dorm beds run ₹400-600 per night. Private rooms with a fan and shared bathroom cost ₹500-800. A private room with AC and attached bathroom runs ₹800-1,500. At the upper end, a few guesthouses offer cleaned-up rooms with hot water and Wi-Fi for ₹1,500-2,500. Prices are negotiable for stays longer than 2-3 nights, especially in low season (April-September). Always inspect the room before committing — quality varies wildly even within the same building."

**Paharganj is worth staying in only if you're an experienced budget traveller comfortable with noise, chaos, and rough edges — and if saving ₹500-1,000 a night matters more to you than comfort.** For first-time visitors to India, or anyone who values a decent night's sleep, there are better options at similar prices. Here's the honest breakdown.

## What Paharganj Is

Paharganj is the narrow strip of guesthouses, restaurants, and shops running west from the front entrance of New Delhi Railway Station. It became India's backpacker hub in the 1970s and 1980s when overlanders on the hippie trail needed cheap beds near the trains. Decades later, the same mechanics apply — you step off a train at New Delhi station, walk across the road, and you're in the cheapest accommodation zone in the capital.

The **Main Bazaar Road** is the central spine. It runs roughly 1 km from the railway station to Chuna Mandi, lined on both sides with guesthouses stacked above shops selling everything from textiles to travel bookings. Side lanes branch off into narrower alleys with more guesthouses and food stalls.

## The Pros

### Price

Nothing in Delhi beats Paharganj on price. Dorm beds from ₹400-600. Private rooms with AC and a bathroom from ₹800-1,500. That's $5-18 a night. For budget travellers on a long India trip, this adds up to serious savings. Our [daily cost breakdown for Delhi](/delhi/how-much-money-do-i-need-per-day-in-delhi/) shows how this fits into an overall budget.

### Location

New Delhi Railway Station is literally across the road. If you're catching early morning trains (which is common — the Rajdhani Express to Jaipur leaves at 6 AM), being a 5-minute walk from the platform is genuinely useful. The station also has the Airport Express metro line, getting you to Terminal 3 in 20 minutes.

Rajiv Chowk metro (Connaught Place) is a 15-minute walk or one metro stop from New Delhi station, so you're centrally placed for the Yellow and Blue lines.

### The Traveller Scene

If you want to meet other backpackers, Paharganj delivers. Rooftop cafes like Sam's and others along Main Bazaar are where people share route advice, arrange travel companions, and swap stories. This social infrastructure is something cleaner, quieter neighbourhoods don't have. If you're travelling solo and want easy connections, that matters.

### Food Variety

Decades of catering to international backpackers means Paharganj has restaurants serving everything — Israeli food, Korean, Italian, South Indian, Tibetan, and the usual suspects of banana pancakes and muesli. You won't eat the best food in Delhi here, but you'll have options. A filling meal costs ₹150-300.

## The Cons

### Sanitation and Cleanliness

This is the primary issue. Many side lanes have open drains, accumulated rubbish, and a persistent smell that worsens in summer and monsoon. Not every guesthouse is problematic, but the surrounding infrastructure hasn't kept pace with the foot traffic. Rooms in budget guesthouses can have stained sheets, erratic plumbing, and cockroaches. Always inspect before paying.

### Noise

Main Bazaar Road is loud from 7 AM until late at night — honking, vendors, traffic, music from shops. Rooms facing the street get limited sleep potential. Ask for a room at the back or on an upper floor when checking in.

### Touts and Hassle

Walking through Paharganj as a foreign tourist means fielding offers for hotel rooms, travel bookings, hash, taxi rides, and "my uncle's shop" every 30 seconds. It's not threatening, but it's exhausting, especially after a long journey. Repeat visitors learn to walk fast and not make eye contact. First-timers find it draining.

### Safety After Dark

The main road stays somewhat active until 10-11 PM, but the side alleys darken quickly once shops close. Reports of phone snatching and aggressive behaviour toward women increase after dark. Our [Delhi safety guide](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/) covers this in more detail. The bottom line: don't wander the back lanes at night.

## Who Should Stay Here

- **Experienced budget travellers** who have been to South or Southeast Asia before and know what to expect from a ₹800 room
- **Backpackers catching early trains** from New Delhi Railway Station
- **Solo travellers looking for a social scene** at rooftop cafes
- **People staying one or two nights** as a transit stop before heading to Rajasthan or elsewhere

## Who Should Not Stay Here

- **First-time visitors to India** — the intensity of Paharganj on top of Delhi's general intensity is too much. Start somewhere calmer and visit Paharganj during the day if you're curious.
- **Families with children** — the sanitation, noise, and crowding aren't appropriate
- **Anyone who values sleep and comfort** — spend ₹500 more per night and stay in Karol Bagh or Majnu Ka Tila
- **Solo women arriving late at night** — the area around the railway station after dark is uncomfortable for anyone, but especially for women travelling alone

## Better Alternatives at Similar Prices

### Karol Bagh

Three metro stops from Rajiv Chowk on the Blue Line. Budget rooms ₹800-1,500/night. Cleaner streets, better food (Roshan Di Kulfi alone is worth the move), and an honest commercial market. Read more in our [Karol Bagh guide](/delhi/things-to-do-in-karol-bagh/).

### Majnu Ka Tila

Delhi's Tibetan colony in North Delhi. Guesthouses ₹600-1,200/night. Calm, friendly, with excellent Tibetan food. The trade-off is that it's in North Delhi, 30-40 minutes from central locations by metro.

### Connaught Place

If you can stretch to ₹2,500-3,000/night, Bloomrooms near CP puts you in a clean, modern hotel at the city's main metro interchange. A significant step up from Paharganj for not much more money.

## Practical Tips If You Do Stay

1. **Book a room on the main road** rather than deep in the back alleys. More light, more people, easier to find.
2. **Inspect the room before paying.** Check the sheets, bathroom, locks, and windows. Ask to see a second room if the first is poor.
3. **Negotiate for multi-night stays.** Most guesthouses will knock 10-20% off for 3+ nights.
4. **Keep valuables locked.** Use the hotel safe if there is one. Carry a padlock for your bag.
5. **Eat at busy places.** High turnover means fresher food. Empty restaurants at meal time are a warning sign.
6. **Download Uber and Ola** before arriving. App-based transport is far better than negotiating with auto drivers outside the station.
7. **Don't book anything from touts at the railway station.** The "tourist information office" outside is a scam. The real one is inside the station on the first floor.

## Is It Worth It?

For the right traveller — experienced, budget-conscious, flexible — Paharganj is functional. It's not charming, it's not comfortable, and it's not going to give you a favourable first impression of Delhi. But it costs ₹500 a night, it's next to the railway station, and it's been doing this job for 50 years.

For everyone else: spend a bit more and sleep better. The difference between a ₹700 Paharganj room and a ₹1,500 Karol Bagh room is the difference between a mediocre experience and a decent one. Delhi has enough challenges without your hotel being one of them. Check our [budget guide](/delhi/is-delhi-expensive/) for how to keep costs down without sacrificing quality.

Paharganj is reasonably safe during daylight hours on the main bazaar road, where the density of people and shopkeepers provides a natural layer of security.
