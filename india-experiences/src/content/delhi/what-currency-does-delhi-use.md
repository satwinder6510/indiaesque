  - question: "Can I use US dollars or euros in Delhi?"
    answer: "No. Delhi runs entirely on Indian Rupees (₹/INR). No shops, restaurants, or transport accept foreign currency. Exchange your money at the airport, an authorised money changer, or withdraw Rupees from an ATM. As of 2026, $1 USD is approximately ₹83-85. Airport exchange rates are slightly worse than city rates but perfectly fine for your first day's spending."
  - question: "Should I carry cash or use cards in Delhi?"
    answer: "Both. Credit and debit cards (Visa and Mastercard) work at most mid-range to upscale restaurants, hotel chains, malls, and branded shops. But you'll need cash for auto rickshaws, street food, markets like Chandni Chowk and Sarojini Nagar, small shops, and temple donations. Carry ₹2,000-3,000 in cash daily, in small denominations."
  - question: "Where can I exchange money in Delhi?"
    answer: "The best options are ATMs (available at all Metro stations, malls, and main roads), airport exchange counters (open 24/7 at Terminal 3), and authorised money changers in Connaught Place and Paharganj. Avoid exchanging money at hotels — their rates are typically 3-5% worse. Thomas Cook and BookMyForex have offices in CP with competitive rates."

**Delhi uses the Indian Rupee, written as ₹ or INR.** One Rupee is divided into 100 paise, though paise coins are effectively extinct — everything rounds to the nearest Rupee. As of 2026, $1 USD equals roughly ₹83-85, and €1 equals roughly ₹90-93.

You'll use a mix of cash and cards in Delhi. Cards work at most restaurants and larger shops, but cash is king for transport, markets, and street food — which is where a lot of your money goes.

## Getting Rupees

### ATMs

ATMs are everywhere in Delhi — inside Metro stations, at petrol pumps, in malls, attached to bank branches, and on virtually every main road. The most reliable ATM networks for foreign cards are **HDFC Bank**, **ICICI Bank**, **SBI**, and **Axis Bank**.

Withdrawal limits are typically ₹10,000-20,000 ($120-240) per transaction, with some banks allowing ₹25,000. Most ATMs charge foreign card holders ₹200-250 ($2.40-3) per withdrawal — check with your home bank about additional fees on their end.

**Tip:** Withdraw from ATMs inside bank branches during banking hours (10 AM - 4 PM). If the machine eats your card or a transaction fails, bank staff can help immediately. Standalone ATMs at night are less ideal.

### Airport Exchange

Terminal 3 has multiple currency exchange counters in the arrivals hall, open 24/7. The rates are 2-4% worse than city rates, but for your first ₹5,000-10,000, the convenience is worth it. You need your passport to exchange.

### Money Changers in the City

**Connaught Place** has the highest concentration of authorised money changers — look for the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) authorisation certificate displayed in the shop. Thomas Cook, BookMyForex, and several independent changers operate along the inner and outer circles.

**Paharganj** also has many changers, but rates and reliability vary more. Stick to shops with clear RBI authorisation.

Avoid changing money at hotels — their exchange rates are consistently the worst option, typically 3-5% below market rate.

## Using Cards

**Visa and Mastercard** are accepted at most mid-range to high-end restaurants, hotel chains, brand-name shops, malls, and supermarkets. American Express has much more limited acceptance — maybe 30-40% of places that take Visa/MC.

**Where cards work well:**
- Restaurants in Khan Market, Connaught Place, Hauz Khas, and South Delhi
- Hotels at all price levels
- Shopping malls (Select Citywalk, DLF Promenade, Ambience Mall)
- Chain stores and supermarkets (Big Bazaar, Nature's Basket)
- Monument ticket counters (most accept cards now)

**Where you need cash:**
- Auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws
- Street food stalls
- Traditional markets (Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar)
- Small neighbourhood shops
- Temple donations and offerings
- Public toilets

## UPI and Digital Payments

India's UPI (Unified Payments Interface) system has transformed how locals pay. Apps like **Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm** are used by everyone from street vendors to luxury hotels — you'll see QR codes at every shop.

**The catch for tourists:** UPI requires an Indian bank account and Indian phone number. Without those, you can't use it. Some fintech companies now offer UPI access for tourists linked to foreign cards, but it's not yet reliable or widespread. For now, stick to cards and cash.

## Cash Tips

**Carry small denominations.** Notes come in ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, and ₹500. Auto drivers and small vendors frequently can't break a ₹500 note. Ask the ATM for a lower withdrawal amount to get smaller notes, or break large notes at bigger shops and supermarkets.

**₹2,000 notes** were withdrawn from circulation in 2023. If someone gives you one, it's still technically legal tender but nearly impossible to spend — most shopkeepers refuse them. Exchange them at a bank if you somehow end up with one.

**Check your notes.** Torn, excessively worn, or heavily stained notes are sometimes rejected by shopkeepers. If an ATM gives you damaged notes, exchange them inside the bank branch.

**Don't carry too much cash.** ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) in your wallet is plenty for a day. Keep the rest in your hotel safe. For budgeting context, see our guide on [how much money you need per day in Delhi](/delhi/how-much-money-do-i-need-per-day-in-delhi/).

## Bargaining with Cash

Markets like Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, and Janpath are cash-only and prices are negotiable. Having the right denomination makes bargaining easier — if a vendor says ₹800, you can hold up ₹400 in notes and negotiate from there. Paying by card removes this leverage entirely.
