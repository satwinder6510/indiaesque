**Buy a token or Metro smart card at any station, pass through the mandatory security check, and you're on.** The Delhi Metro is the easiest public transport system in India to figure out, and most tourists get the hang of it within their first ride.

The network covers over 390 km across 12 colour-coded lines, reaching everywhere from the airport to Old Delhi to the southern suburbs. If you're spending more than a day in Delhi, you'll use the Metro more than any other form of transport.

## Step 1: Getting Your Ticket

### Single-Journey Tokens

Walk up to the ticket counter inside any Metro station and tell the staff your destination station. They'll hand you a plastic token — a round, coin-sized disc — and charge you ₹10-60 ($0.12-0.72) depending on distance. You can also use the **Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVMs)** which accept coins and ₹10/₹20 notes.

Tap the token on the reader at the entry gate, and the gate opens. When you arrive at your destination, drop the token into the slot at the exit gate.

### Metro Smart Card

If you're in Delhi for more than 2-3 days, get a smart card. It costs ₹150 ($1.80) — that's ₹50 refundable deposit plus ₹100 starting balance. Buy it at any station's ticket counter.

The card gives you a **10% discount** on every journey. Tap it at entry and exit — the fare is deducted automatically. Recharge at counters or ATVMs in increments of ₹100-1,000.

The smart card also works on **Airport Express Line** trains and some DTC bus routes, though you're unlikely to use the buses.

## Step 2: Security Check

Every Delhi Metro station has a mandatory security screening — similar to airport security but faster. You'll put your bags through an X-ray machine and walk through a metal detector. There are separate lines for men and women.

This takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the crowd. At major interchange stations like **Rajiv Chowk** or **Kashmere Gate** during rush hour, the security queue can stretch to 5-10 minutes.

**Tip:** Carry a small bag. The bigger your luggage, the longer security takes. Large suitcases are technically allowed but very inconvenient on crowded trains. If you're heading to the airport with big bags, use the [Airport Express Line](/delhi/how-do-i-get-from-delhi-airport-to-the-city/) where trains are less crowded.

## Step 3: Finding Your Platform

Once through security, follow the signs to your platform. The colour-coded system makes this simple:

- **Yellow Line** — the most useful for tourists, connecting Chandni Chowk, Rajiv Chowk (CP), and HUDA City Centre
- **Blue Line** — runs east-west through Rajiv Chowk, Karol Bagh, and Dwarka
- **Violet Line** — connects Kashmere Gate to Escorts Mujesar, passing through INA and Nehru Place
- **Magenta Line** — links Hauz Khas to the airport area
- **Orange Line (Airport Express)** — direct service from New Delhi station to Terminal 3

Each platform has electronic displays showing the next train's destination and arrival time. Announcements are in Hindi and English.

## Step 4: Boarding the Train

Trains arrive every 2-5 minutes during peak hours (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM) and every 5-8 minutes off-peak. Stand behind the yellow line on the platform and let passengers exit before boarding.

### The Women's Carriage

The **first coach in the direction of travel** is reserved for women. It's marked with pink signs on the platform and inside the train. Men can be fined ₹250 for travelling in this carriage. If you're a woman travelling solo, this is a good option during rush hour — it's typically less crowded and more comfortable.

### Rush Hour Reality

Between 8-10 AM and 5-8 PM on weekdays, popular stations like Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, and Botanical Garden get extremely packed. You may need to let one or two trains pass before you can board. If you can shift your sightseeing schedule to start at 10:30 AM instead of 9:00 AM, your Metro experience improves dramatically.

## Step 5: Exiting

When you reach your station, tap your smart card or insert your token at the exit gate. Follow signs to the exit that's closest to your destination — large stations like Rajiv Chowk have 8+ exits, and picking the right one saves you a 10-minute walk above ground.

**Google Maps** will often tell you which exit number to use. The station maps posted near the exits also help.

## Practical Tips

**Food and water are banned** inside trains and stations. You can carry a water bottle but don't drink from it on the platform or in the train — you can be fined ₹200.

**Phone charging points** are available at some stations but not inside trains. Keep your phone charged before you head out — you'll need Google Maps.

**Lost something?** Go to the station master's office at the station where you think you lost it, or call the Metro helpline at 155370.

**Luggage limits** technically exist (15 kg per person) but are rarely enforced unless you're carrying something obviously oversized. Don't bring bicycles or large carts.
