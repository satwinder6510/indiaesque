  - question: "What are the best markets in Delhi for tourists?"
    answer: "The five best markets for visitors are Chandni Chowk (wholesale goods, street food, fabric), Khan Market (upscale boutiques and cafes), Sarojini Nagar (fashion at rock-bottom prices), Dilli Haat (handicrafts from every Indian state), and Janpath (quick souvenirs near Connaught Place). Each serves a different purpose and price range."
  - question: "Which Delhi market is best for souvenirs?"
    answer: "Dilli Haat is the easiest option — ₹30 entry gets you into an open-air bazaar with handicrafts, textiles, and pottery from across India, all at fixed-ish prices. Janpath Market near Connaught Place is faster if you just need scarves, jewellery, or small gifts. For spices, head to Khari Baoli in Old Delhi."
  - question: "Are Delhi markets safe for tourists?"
    answer: "Yes. Delhi's major markets are busy and well-policed during daytime hours. Keep your phone in a front pocket in crowded areas like Chandni Chowk. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Most markets wind down by 8-9 PM, and it's fine to shop until closing."

**Delhi has over 100 named markets, but five stand out for visitors: Chandni Chowk for everything under the sun, Khan Market for upscale browsing, Sarojini Nagar for fashion bargains, Dilli Haat for handicrafts, and Janpath for quick souvenirs.** Each one delivers a completely different experience, and you could easily spend a half-day at any of them.

## Chandni Chowk — The Original Delhi Market

Chandni Chowk is Old Delhi's commercial spine, running west from Red Fort for about 1.5 km. It dates to the 1650s and remains one of the largest and oldest markets in Asia. There's no single "Chandni Chowk market" — it's a network of specialised lanes, each selling something different.

**Dariba Kalan** is the silver and jewellery lane. **Kinari Bazaar** sells wedding accessories, embroidered fabrics, and decorative trimmings. **Nai Sarak** is all books and stationery. And **Khari Baoli**, at the western end, is Asia's largest spice market — read our full guide on [where to buy spices in Delhi](/delhi/where-to-buy-spices-in-delhi/).

Getting there: Yellow Line metro to Chandni Chowk station. Markets open around 10 AM (some lanes by 11 AM) and close by 8 PM. Closed on Sundays.

Expect to bargain hard here. Start at about 50% of the asking price and meet somewhere in the middle. For more on this, see our guide on [bargaining in Delhi markets](/delhi/is-bargaining-expected-in-delhi-markets/).

## Khan Market — Delhi's Upscale Strip

Khan Market is a horseshoe-shaped market in central Delhi, packed with independent bookshops (Bahrisons is legendary), boutique clothing stores, international cafes, and organic grocery shops. It's one of the most expensive retail stretches in India — a cup of coffee runs ₹300-500 ($3.60-6), and clothing starts higher than at most Delhi markets.

That said, it's a genuinely pleasant place to browse. The bookshops alone are worth the trip. Grab lunch at **Big Chill** or a flat white at **Perch**, and wander the lanes behind the main curve for smaller shops selling handmade jewellery and leather goods.

Nearest metro: Khan Market (Violet Line). Open Monday to Saturday, roughly 10:30 AM to 8 PM. Learn more in our full breakdown of [whether Khan Market is expensive](/delhi/is-khan-market-expensive/).

## Sarojini Nagar — Where Delhi Buys Clothes

If you want cheap fashion, Sarojini Nagar is the market. It's an open-air sprawl near the INA area where you'll find export-surplus Western brands, Indian clothing, shoes, bags, and accessories at prices that seem absurd — branded t-shirts for ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40), dresses for ₹200-500 ($2.40-6), jeans for ₹300-600 ($3.60-7).

The trick is patience. Not everything here is gold — you're sifting through piles to find the good pieces. Go on a weekday morning if you want breathing room. Weekends are a full-contact sport.

Nearest metro: Sarojini Nagar (Pink Line). Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 AM to 9 PM. Closed Mondays.

## Dilli Haat — Handicrafts Without the Hassle

[Dilli Haat](/delhi/what-is-dilli-haat/) is an open-air crafts bazaar run by the Delhi Tourism department. Entry costs just ₹30 ($0.35). Inside, artisans from different Indian states sell textiles, pottery, wooden carvings, metalwork, and paintings at their own stalls. The vendors rotate, so the selection changes every few weeks.

There's also a ring of food stalls serving regional dishes from across India — Rajasthani dal baati, Nagaland pork, Kerala fish curry. Plan to eat here.

Location: Aurobindo Marg, opposite INA Market. Nearest metro: INA (Yellow Line). Open daily 10 AM to 10 PM.

## Janpath Market — Quick Souvenirs Near CP

Janpath is a narrow strip of stalls along Janpath Road, a 5-minute walk from Connaught Place. It's geared toward tourists, selling Tibetan jewellery, cotton scarves, printed kurtas, leather journals, incense, and small brass items. Prices are low but you still need to bargain — start at 40-50% of the quoted price.

It's not the most authentic market experience in Delhi, but it's convenient if you need gifts fast and don't want to trek across the city.

Nearest metro: Rajiv Chowk (Yellow/Blue Line). Open Monday to Saturday, roughly 10 AM to 8 PM.

## How to Plan Your Market Day

If you only have time for one market, choose based on what you want:

- **Everything in one trip**: Chandni Chowk
- **Quality over quantity**: Khan Market
- **Fashion bargains**: Sarojini Nagar
- **Handicrafts and regional food**: Dilli Haat
- **Quick gifts near your hotel**: Janpath
