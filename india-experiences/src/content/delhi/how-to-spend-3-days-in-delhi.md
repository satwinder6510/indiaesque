**Three days is the sweet spot for Delhi — enough to cover the major monuments, eat your way through Old Delhi, and explore a few neighbourhoods beyond the tourist trail.** Here's a practical day-by-day itinerary with specific timings, costs, and metro routes.

## Day 1: Old Delhi — History and Street Food

Old Delhi is intense, loud, and completely absorbing. Dedicate your first full day here while your energy is fresh.

### Morning (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM)

Take the Yellow Line metro to **Chandni Chowk station**. Walk south to **Red Fort**, which opens at 9:30 AM. Entry is ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign visitors. The Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) and the marble Diwan-i-Khas are the highlights — budget 90 minutes inside.

Exit through Lahori Gate and walk straight into **Chandni Chowk**. The street was designed by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's daughter in the 1650s, and the basic layout hasn't changed. Stick to the main road first, then take the side lanes.

### Midday (12:30 PM - 2:30 PM)

Walk to **Jama Masjid**, about 10 minutes south of Chandni Chowk. India's largest mosque holds 25,000 worshippers. Entry is free; the minaret climb costs ₹100 ($1.20) and gives you the best rooftop view in Old Delhi.

Lunch at **Karim's** near Gate 1 of Jama Masjid. Order the mutton korma and seekh kebabs. Budget ₹400-600 ($5-7) per person. Or walk to **Paranthe Wali Gali** in Chandni Chowk for stuffed paranthas fried in ghee — ₹80-150 ($1-2) each.

### Afternoon (3:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

Walk through **Kinari Bazaar** (wedding supplies — every colour of fabric you can imagine) and **Dariba Kalan** (silver jewellery market, operating since the Mughal era). End at **Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib** on Chandni Chowk — a beautiful Sikh temple where anyone can sit in the langar hall for a free communal meal.

### Evening

Head back to your hotel to recharge, or go straight to **Connaught Place** (Rajiv Chowk metro) for dinner. **Rajdhani** does a Gujarati-Rajasthani thali for about ₹700 ($8.50), or try the rooftop at **Farzi Cafe** for modern Indian food.

## Day 2: New Delhi — Monuments and Grand Avenues

Today is more spread out. Use the metro and Uber to cover ground between sites.

### Morning (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)

Start early at **Humayun's Tomb** (nearest metro: JLN Stadium, then a ₹30 auto). This 1570 tomb complex is the architectural rehearsal for the Taj Mahal. Entry is ₹550 ($6.50) for foreigners. The gardens are gorgeous in morning light, and the surrounding complex has smaller tombs most visitors miss — look for Isa Khan's octagonal tomb near the entrance.

### Late Morning (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM)

Walk or take an auto to **Lodhi Gardens**, about 2 km north. Free entry. Fifteenth-century tombs sit among ancient trees, and joggers circle the paths alongside peacocks. The **Bara Gumbad** and **Sheesh Gumbad** tombs are the standouts.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

Grab lunch in **Khan Market** (one of Delhi's best eating streets). **Perch** does excellent coffee and light meals. **Big Chill** has solid Italian food. Expect ₹800-1,200 ($10-15).

After lunch, drive or metro to **India Gate** and the **Kartavya Path** ceremonial boulevard. Walk from India Gate towards Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President's residence) — the Lutyens-designed avenue is one of the grandest urban vistas in Asia.

### Evening

Visit the **National Gallery of Modern Art** near India Gate (₹20 for Indians, ₹500 for foreigners) if you have time. Then head to the **Agrasen Ki Baoli** stepwell on Hailey Road — it's free, uncrowded, and eerily atmospheric as the light fades.

## Day 3: South Delhi and Deeper Experiences

Day 3 takes you away from the monument circuit and into the Delhi that residents actually live in.

### Morning (8:00 AM - 11:30 AM)

Head to **Qutub Minar** in Mehrauli, Delhi's oldest monument complex. The 72-metre tower dates to 1193 and the iron pillar in the courtyard has resisted rust for 1,600 years. Entry ₹550 ($6.50). Go early to avoid tour groups.

Afterwards, walk five minutes to **Mehrauli Archaeological Park** — a free, open site with over 100 ruins spanning 1,000 years. Almost no tourists come here.

### Midday (12:00 PM - 2:30 PM)

Book a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) for the middle of the day. A guided food walk through Old Delhi or South Delhi's markets typically costs ₹2,000-4,000 ($24-48) per person including all tastings. This is hands-down the best way to eat in Delhi — your guide will take you to stalls you'd never identify on your own.

### Afternoon (3:00 PM - 5:30 PM)

Explore **Hauz Khas Village** — a cluster of design boutiques, cafes, and art galleries built around a 13th-century reservoir and madrasa ruins. Walk around the lake, browse the shops on the main lane, and grab coffee at **Ama Cafe** or **Coast Cafe**.

### Evening (6:30 PM onwards)

End your Delhi trip at **Nizamuddin Dargah**, the Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Thursday evenings feature live **qawwali** music sessions that start after sunset prayers — it's one of the most powerful musical experiences in India. Free entry, but the lanes leading to the shrine sell flower offerings for ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20).

Dinner at **Karim's Nizamuddin** branch or at **Lakhori** in Old Delhi if you want a rooftop dinner overlooking the old city skyline.
