A food tour in Delhi is the fastest way to eat your way through 400 years of culinary history without getting lost in the lanes of Old Delhi or accidentally ordering something your stomach isn't ready for. The best tours cover 8-12 stops over 3-4 hours, and you'll eat more in a single morning than most restaurants serve in an evening.

This guide covers what to expect on a Delhi food tour, the main areas where tours operate, what you'll eat, and how to book. If you're planning your wider trip, start with our [Delhi city guide](/delhi/) for an overview of everything the city offers.

## What To Expect On A Delhi Food Tour

Most food tours in Delhi follow a similar format. You meet your guide at a metro station — usually Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line) or Chawri Bazaar (Yellow Line) — between 9:00am and 10:00am. Some operators run evening tours starting at 5:00pm or 6:00pm, which catch the dinner rush.

From there, you walk 2-4 kilometres through narrow lanes, stopping at stalls and small restaurants that your guide has a relationship with. Portions are kept small so you can pace yourself across 8-12 stops. Most tours last 3-4 hours, though some premium private tours extend to 5 hours and include a sit-down meal at the end.

**Group tours** typically have 6-12 people and cost ₹1,500-3,500 ($18-42) per person. Food is included in the price — you don't pay at each stop. Water is usually provided. Some operators include a bottle of Kingfisher or a lassi at the end.

**Private tours** cost ₹3,000-6,000 ($36-72) per person (minimum 2 people) and let you adjust the pace, skip items you don't want, and ask more questions. If you have dietary restrictions, a private tour is the better bet.

**Combo tours** pair food with a heritage walk or a cooking class. These run 5-7 hours and cost ₹4,000-8,000 ($48-96). You'll eat street food in the morning, then cook a meal in someone's home kitchen in the afternoon. The combination gives you both sides of Delhi's food culture in a single day.

## Where The Tours Go

### Old Delhi: Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid

This is the most popular route and where 80% of food tours operate. The stretch from Chandni Chowk metro station south to Jama Masjid packs in more food history per lane than anywhere else in India.

You'll walk through Paranthe Wali Gali — a narrow alley that's been serving stuffed parathas since the 1870s. The original shops are still there, frying parathas stuffed with everything from potato and paneer to rabri and mixed dry fruits. Read more about this lane in our [Paranthe Wali Gali guide](/delhi/what-is-paranthe-wali-gali/).

From there, tours typically head toward Jama Masjid, stopping for:

- **Kebabs:** Seekh kebabs and galouti kebabs at stalls around Gate 1 of Jama Masjid. Karim's, founded in 1913, is the most famous — the mutton burra kebab is the signature dish.
- **Nihari:** A slow-cooked meat stew eaten for breakfast in Old Delhi. The best nihari stalls serve it from 5am-9am, but tour-friendly spots keep it going until noon.
- **Jalebi:** Deep-fried spirals soaked in sugar syrup, served hot. Old Famous Jalebi Wala near the Dariba Kalan crossing is the most photographed, but there are better options deeper in the lanes.
- **Chole bhature:** Spiced chickpea curry with puffed fried bread. This is a Punjabi-Delhi staple — you'll find it at every second stall in Chandni Chowk.
- **Daulat ki chaat:** A seasonal winter delicacy (October to February) made from whipped milk foam, saffron, and pistachios. It dissolves on your tongue in seconds. Stalls appear on Chandni Chowk only during cold months.
- **Kulfi and rabri falooda:** Dense, slow-churned ice cream served with vermicelli noodles and rose syrup. The best kulfi in Old Delhi is made without machines — just metal cans rotated in ice-salt mixture.

The full [Old Delhi eating guide](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/) covers sit-down restaurants and stalls beyond the tour circuit.

### Nizamuddin

Fewer tours operate here, but the ones that do are excellent. The area around Nizamuddin Dargah has its own food culture — more Mughlai and Awadhi, less Punjabi. Think slow-cooked biryani, shammi kebabs, and korma. Nizamuddin is also where you'll find some of Delhi's best bakeries, including the legendary Sufi bakeries that make sheermal (saffron flatbread) in tandoors.

Nizamuddin tours often pair food with a visit to the dargah itself — the shrine of the 14th-century Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. If you're visiting on a Thursday evening, you can catch the qawwali performance after dinner.

### South Delhi: Modern Food Scene

A handful of operators now run tours focused on Delhi's contemporary food scene — think Hauz Khas Village restaurants, Champa Gali coffee roasters, and the street food of INA Market. These tours are better for repeat visitors who've already done the Old Delhi circuit, or for travellers whose stomachs prefer modern hygiene standards.

South Delhi tours are harder to find and often need to be booked as private experiences. Expect to pay ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) per person.

## What You'll Eat: A Typical Tour Menu

A standard Old Delhi food tour hits these categories:

1. **Breakfast bread** — Paratha or poori with aloo sabzi
2. **Chaat** — Gol gappe (panipuri), papdi chaat, or dahi bhalla
3. **Kebabs** — Seekh kebab, shami kebab, or chicken tikka
4. **Curry + bread** — Nihari with naan, or chole with bhature
5. **Sweets** — Jalebi, gulab jamun, or rabri
6. **Drink** — Lassi (sweet yoghurt drink), shikanji (spiced lemonade), or chai
7. **Seasonal special** — Daulat ki chaat in winter, thandai in summer, or kulfi year-round

Most tours include 8-12 distinct tastings. Portions are small — about 3-4 bites each — so the total is equivalent to two full meals. This is why every guide says the same thing: skip breakfast before the tour.

## Tips For Your Food Tour

**Skip breakfast.** Seriously. You'll eat the equivalent of two meals on the tour. Have tea or coffee and nothing else.

**Wear comfortable shoes.** You'll walk 2-4 kilometres on uneven surfaces — broken pavement, cobblestones, and the occasional puddle of uncertain origin. Closed-toe shoes are better than sandals in Old Delhi.

**Bring cash.** Most stalls in Old Delhi don't accept cards. The tour price covers your food, but you may want to buy extras — a box of sweets, a bag of spices, a cup of chai that catches your eye. ₹500-1,000 in small notes is enough.

**Communicate dietary restrictions early.** Most tour operators can accommodate vegetarian, vegan, Jain, and gluten-free diets if you tell them at booking. Halal is default in Muslim areas of Old Delhi. If you have severe allergies (nuts, dairy), a private tour gives you more control.

**Pace yourself.** The first three stops always taste incredible because you're hungry. By stop six, you'll think you're done. By stop nine, you'll wish you'd eaten less at stop three. Good guides manage this — they'll tell you when to eat half a portion and save room.

**Bring a water bottle.** Most tours provide bottled water, but an extra 500ml doesn't hurt, especially in warm months. Never drink tap water, and avoid ice at stalls unless the tour guide specifically says it's from purified water.

**Photography is welcome.** Stall owners are generally happy to be photographed, especially on guided tours where the guide has a relationship with them. Ask first for portraits, and buy something if you spend time photographing their setup.

If you're worried about food safety, read our guide on [whether street food is safe in Delhi](/delhi/is-street-food-safe-in-delhi/). The short version: guided tours stick to vetted stalls with high turnover, which dramatically reduces risk.

## How To Book

Most food tours can be booked online 1-7 days in advance. During peak season (October-March), popular morning slots sell out 3-4 days ahead — book as early as you can.

**What to check before booking:**

- **Group size:** Smaller groups (6-8 people) move faster and get more guide attention. Tours with 12-15 people can feel rushed.
- **Inclusions:** Confirm that all food tastings are included in the price. Some cheaper tours list "optional" paid stops.
- **Meeting point:** Most tours meet at a metro station, not at a hotel. Budget 30-45 minutes to reach Chandni Chowk or Chawri Bazaar from South Delhi or Connaught Place.
- **Start time:** Morning tours (9:00-10:00am) beat the midday heat from March onwards. Evening tours (5:00-6:00pm) catch the dinner crowd and a different selection of stalls.
- **Cancellation policy:** Most operators offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before. Check the specific policy.

Payment is usually online (credit card or UPI) at booking. Some operators accept cash on the day, but online payment guarantees your spot.
