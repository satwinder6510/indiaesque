  - question: "Where is the best place to buy spices in Delhi?"
    answer: "Khari Baoli in Old Delhi is the best place — it's Asia's largest wholesale spice market, operating since the 17th century. Whole spices here cost 50-70% less than Delhi supermarkets and a fraction of international prices. The market runs along a single street near Fatehpuri Masjid, accessible from Chandni Chowk or Chawri Bazaar metro stations."
  - question: "What spices should I buy in Delhi?"
    answer: "The best buys are Kashmiri saffron (₹300-800 per gram depending on grade), green cardamom (₹200-400 per 100g), whole dried red Kashmiri chillies, black pepper, star anise, cinnamon sticks, and pre-mixed garam masala. Buy whole spices rather than ground — they last longer and taste fresher. Most vendors will vacuum-seal your purchase for travel."
  - question: "Can you bring spices from India in your luggage?"
    answer: "Yes. Whole and ground spices are permitted in checked and carry-on luggage for most international destinations including the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Australia. Pack them in sealed bags to avoid smell transfer. Saffron has no special restrictions. Fresh herbs, seeds intended for planting, and soil-attached items may be restricted — check your destination country's customs rules."

**Khari Baoli in Old Delhi is where you buy spices in Delhi — it's Asia's largest spice market, and prices here are 50-70% lower than Delhi supermarkets and a tiny fraction of what you'd pay abroad.** The market has operated near Fatehpuri Masjid since the Mughal era, and the smell hits you before you even turn the corner.

## Khari Baoli: The Main Event

Khari Baoli is a single street packed with wholesale and retail spice shops, running south from Fatehpuri Masjid at the western end of Chandni Chowk. The shops spill onto the pavement with towering sacks of turmeric, chilli powder, cumin, coriander, dried fruits, and nuts.

Despite the wholesale focus, every shop here sells retail quantities too. You can buy 100g of cardamom as easily as 10kg. Just walk in, ask for what you want, and they'll weigh it out.

### How to Get There

Take the Yellow Line metro to **Chandni Chowk station** and walk west along the main road for about 1.2 km until you reach Fatehpuri Masjid — Khari Baoli starts right there. Alternatively, take the Yellow Line to **Chawri Bazaar station** and walk north. An auto-rickshaw from Connaught Place costs about ₹80-100 ($1-1.20).

### Hours

Most shops open by 10:30 AM and close around 7:30-8:00 PM. The market is **closed on Sundays**. Go on a weekday morning for the least crowded experience.

## What to Buy

Here's a practical shopping list with current price ranges:

### The Essentials

| Spice | Price per 100g | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Kashmiri saffron | ₹300-800 ($3.60-9.60) | Price varies hugely by grade. Ask to smell it — real saffron has a distinct honey-metallic aroma |
| Green cardamom | ₹200-400 ($2.40-4.80) | Look for plump, bright green pods. Avoid bleached-white ones |
| Black cardamom | ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) | Smoky, used in biryanis and curries |
| Whole Kashmiri red chillies | ₹80-150 ($1-1.80) | Deep red, mild heat, used for colour more than spice |
| Black pepper (Tellicherry) | ₹100-250 ($1.20-3) | Tellicherry grade is the largest and most aromatic |
| Star anise | ₹80-150 ($1-1.80) | Whole stars — check they're intact, not broken |
| Cinnamon sticks (true cinnamon) | ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) | Thin, papery rolls. Different from the thick cassia bark common in Western supermarkets |
| Cumin seeds | ₹40-80 ($0.50-1) | An absolute staple |
| Coriander seeds | ₹30-60 ($0.35-0.70) | Often the cheapest spice to buy |

### Pre-Mixed Blends

Most shops sell their own **garam masala** blends — typically a mix of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, and cumin, ground fresh. A 250g bag costs ₹100-250 ($1.20-3). **Biryani masala** and **chaat masala** are also popular blends to take home.

Ask the vendor to grind spices fresh for you — many have grinders in the back of the shop. Freshly ground spices are more aromatic, though they have a shorter shelf life (6-8 months vs. 1-2 years for whole spices).

### Dried Fruits and Nuts

Khari Baoli also sells dried fruits and nuts at wholesale prices. Cashews, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, dried figs, and apricots are significantly cheaper here than in retail shops. A kilo of cashews runs ₹600-1,000 ($7-12) depending on grade.

## How to Shop Smart

**Buy whole, not ground.** Whole spices are harder to adulterate, last longer, and taste better when freshly ground at home. The only exceptions are blends like garam masala, which are fine pre-ground.

**Ask for vacuum sealing.** Most established shops at Khari Baoli will vacuum-seal your purchases at no extra cost. This keeps spices fresh during travel and prevents your entire suitcase from smelling like cumin.

**Compare across 2-3 shops.** Prices are competitive, but they do vary. Walk past a few stalls before buying, especially for saffron — which has the widest price range and the most potential for quality variation.

**Bargain lightly.** Khari Baoli is a wholesale market, so margins are already thin. You can ask for a small discount, especially on larger quantities, but don't expect the aggressive back-and-forth you'd have at Janpath or Sarojini Nagar.

**Bring your own bags.** Vendors provide plastic bags, but if you're buying multiple items, a tote or backpack keeps things organised.

## Other Places to Buy Spices in Delhi

If you don't make it to Khari Baoli, you have alternatives:

- **INA Market** (near INA metro, Yellow Line) — a covered market with spice stalls, not as cheap as Khari Baoli but more relaxed and easier to navigate
- **Dilli Haat** — some stalls sell regional spice blends, though the selection is limited
- **Nature's Basket / Foodhall** — upscale grocery chains in South Delhi malls with packaged spices at higher prices but convenient packaging
- **Airport duty-free** — the most expensive option but useful if you forgot to shop
