**Yes, you can absolutely do a cycling tour in Delhi — and it's one of the best ways to see Old Delhi before the city wakes up.** Delhi By Cycle is the most established operator, running daily rides that start at 6am and cost ₹1,500-2,000 ($18-24) per person.

The idea of cycling through Delhi might sound insane if you've seen the daytime traffic. But at 6am, the roads are a different city entirely. Shopkeepers are hosing down their storefronts, chai wallahs are firing up their stoves, and the lanes of Shahjahanabad are quiet enough to hear pigeons on the rooftops. By 9am, you're done and back before the chaos begins.

## How Cycling Tours Work

Most tours meet at a fixed point near **Jama Masjid** or **Kashmere Gate**. You'll get a hybrid bike, helmet, and a quick briefing. The route weaves through the narrow galis of Old Delhi — past **Chandni Chowk**, through the spice market at **Khari Baoli**, along the backstreets behind **Red Fort**, and into residential lanes where you'd never wander on foot.

Guides ride at the front and back of the group. The pace is slow — you stop every few hundred metres to look at something, hear a story, or snap a photo. Total distance is 10-15 kilometres, but it takes 3-3.5 hours because the stops are the whole point.

Some tours loop through **New Delhi** instead, covering **Lutyens' Delhi** — Rajpath (now Kartavya Path), India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the tree-lined avenues of the diplomatic enclave. These are flatter and faster, better if you want exercise rather than culture.

If you're spending more time in the old city, check our guide to [things to do in Old Delhi](/delhi/things-to-do-in-old-delhi-chandni-chowk/) for what to hit after the ride.

## Who Runs Cycling Tours

**Delhi By Cycle** is the original and still the best. Founded in 2009, they run the Shahjahanabad morning tour daily from October to March, and on request during shoulder season. Their bikes are well-maintained Trek hybrids, and guides are trained historians who actually know the lanes.

**DelhiByCycle.com** — Book directly on their website at least 24 hours ahead. Groups are capped at 12-14 riders.

**Heritage Cycle Tours** and **Art of Bicycle Trips** also operate in Delhi, with similar pricing and routes. Heritage Cycle focuses more on Mughal architecture; Art of Bicycle Trips does multi-day rides that extend to Agra.

## What It Costs

| Tour | Price | Duration |
|------|-------|----------|
| Old Delhi Sunrise | ₹1,500-2,000 ($18-24) | 3-3.5 hours |
| New Delhi Heritage | ₹1,800-2,500 ($22-30) | 3 hours |
| Custom Private Ride | ₹3,000-4,000 ($36-48) | 3-4 hours |

All prices include bike rental, helmet, water, and guide. Private rides can be customised to include breakfast at a local dhaba or a stop at a specific market.

## What To Know Before You Go

**Start time is non-negotiable.** Tours leave at 6am sharp. By 8:30am, Old Delhi's roads fill with cycle rickshaws, handcarts, and delivery trucks, and cycling becomes impractical. Show up at 5:45am.

**Wear closed-toe shoes.** The lanes have uneven cobblestones, open drains, and occasional puddles. Sandals won't cut it.

**Bring a camera.** The early morning light in Old Delhi is extraordinary — golden hour hits the minarets of Jama Masjid perfectly. For more on where to shoot, see our [Delhi photography spots guide](/delhi/best-photography-spots-in-delhi/).

**Flat terrain.** Delhi sits on a plain. There's not a single hill on any route. If you can ride a bike, you can do this tour.

**October to March is prime season.** Morning temperatures are 8-18°C, which is perfect for riding. April and May mornings hit 28-30°C by 7am. Monsoon (July-August) tours are usually cancelled.

## Combine With A Food Tour

The smartest move is to pair your cycling tour with a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) later the same morning. You'll finish cycling by 9-9:30am, right when the food tour operators meet at Chandni Chowk metro station. You'll already be in the area, already hungry, and already familiar with the lanes. Some operators even build breakfast tastings into the cycling route — ask when you book.
