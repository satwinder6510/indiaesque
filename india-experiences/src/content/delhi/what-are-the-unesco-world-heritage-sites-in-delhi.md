**Delhi has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Red Fort (designated 2007), Humayun's Tomb (1993), and the Qutub Minar complex (1993).** All three are Mughal or pre-Mughal era monuments maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, and you can visit all of them in a single well-planned day.

## Red Fort (Lal Qila)

Red Fort is Delhi's most iconic monument — a massive red sandstone fortress built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1638 and 1648 when he moved the capital from Agra to Delhi. The fort served as the Mughal imperial residence for nearly 200 years.

The walls stretch 2.5 km around the complex, and the main attractions inside include the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audiences), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audiences), the Rang Mahal, and the Mumtaz Mahal, which now houses a small museum. The Nahr-i-Behisht, or "Stream of Paradise," once flowed through the private chambers — the channels are still visible in the marble floors.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: ₹35 ($0.40) Indians, ₹500 ($6) foreigners
- Hours: 9:30 AM - 4:30 PM, closed Mondays
- Sound and Light Show: evenings at 6:00 PM (winter) / 7:30 PM (summer), ₹80 ($1)
- Metro: Chandni Chowk station (Yellow Line), then 10-minute walk east through the market
- Time needed: 1.5-2 hours

The best approach is to arrive right at opening. By 11 AM the school groups descend, and the courtyards get packed. Read our detailed guide on [whether Red Fort is worth visiting](/delhi/is-red-fort-worth-visiting/) for more tips.

After Red Fort, you're already in Old Delhi — walk west along Chandni Chowk for street food, or south to Jama Masjid.

## Humayun's Tomb

This is the one that architecture lovers come to Delhi for. Built in 1570 by Empress Bega Begum for her husband Emperor Humayun, it's the first garden tomb on the Indian subcontinent and the direct architectural ancestor of the Taj Mahal, built 83 years later.

The tomb sits at the centre of a formal Mughal char bagh (four-part garden) divided by water channels. The double dome — an inner dome visible from the burial chamber and an outer dome creating the exterior silhouette — was revolutionary at the time and became the template for Mughal architecture going forward.

The surrounding complex is worth exploring beyond the main tomb. Isa Khan's octagonal tomb and mosque (1547) sit near the entrance. The Barber's Tomb is to the southwest. The Nila Gumbad (Blue Dome) was recently restored. And the adjacent **Sunder Nursery**, a beautifully restored Mughal heritage garden, opened to the public in 2018 with 15 monuments of its own. Entry to Sunder Nursery is free.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: ₹35 ($0.40) Indians, ₹550 ($6.50) foreigners
- Hours: Sunrise to sunset, open daily
- Metro: JLN Stadium (Violet Line), then auto-rickshaw for ₹30-40
- Time needed: 1-1.5 hours (add 45 minutes for Sunder Nursery)

## Qutub Minar Complex

The Qutub Minar is a 73-metre sandstone and marble tower built starting in 1192 by Qutub-ud-din Aibak to celebrate the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. It's the tallest brick minaret in the world, and the intricate Arabic inscriptions and floral patterns carved into each of its five storeys are remarkable — bring binoculars if you have them.

The complex around the tower is just as interesting. The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, built with columns pillaged from 27 Hindu and Jain temples, shows a fascinating collision of architectural styles. The iron pillar in the courtyard, dating to the 4th century, has famously resisted corrosion for over 1,600 years. And the unfinished Alai Minar — Sultan Alauddin Khalji's attempt to build a tower twice as tall — stands as a 24-metre stump, abandoned after his death in 1316.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: ₹35 ($0.40) Indians, ₹550 ($6.50) foreigners
- Hours: Sunrise to sunset, open daily
- Metro: Qutub Minar station (Yellow Line), then 800m walk
- Time needed: 1-1.5 hours

Go in the morning for the best light on the tower — the carvings catch the sun beautifully before 10 AM. The adjacent [Mehrauli Archaeological Park](/delhi/what-is-mehrauli-archaeological-park/) is free and adds another hour of exploration if you're interested.

## Visiting All Three in One Day

If you want to see all three in a day, here's the route that works best:

**Morning:** Start at Qutub Minar (opens at sunrise). Arrive by 7 AM for soft light and empty grounds. Spend 60-90 minutes.

**Late morning:** Head to Humayun's Tomb. By car it's 30-40 minutes via Aurobindo Marg. Spend 60-90 minutes at the tomb and Sunder Nursery.

**Afternoon:** Drive or metro to Red Fort. It's about 40 minutes from Nizamuddin area. Tour the fort, then step out into Chandni Chowk for lunch.

This route moves south to north, which works well with morning light at Qutub Minar and avoids backtracking across the city.

Join one of the [heritage walks](/delhi/heritage-walks/) if you want context and stories that signboards don't cover — INTACH and Delhi Heritage Walks both run routes connecting these sites with the smaller monuments between them.
