**Hauz Khas Village is Delhi's nightlife epicentre — 15+ bars stacked along a narrow lane, open until 1am, with everything from rooftop lounges to reggae dives.** Connaught Place has the city's best cocktail bars and live music venues, while Cyber Hub in Gurgaon is where the expense-account crowd heads for polished international-standard drinking.

Delhi's nightlife doesn't match Mumbai's or Goa's in scale, but it punches above its weight for variety. The city has craft beer taprooms, Bollywood DJ nights, jazz clubs, qawwali-infused supper clubs, and whisky bars with 200+ labels. The main constraint is the 1am closing time — start early, drink fast (or pace yourself and enjoy fewer venues).

## Hauz Khas Village

The narrow, car-free lane of Hauz Khas Village is where most of Delhi goes on a Saturday night. The bars are stacked vertically — ground floor, first floor, terrace — and the lane itself becomes a street party after 10pm.

**Social, Hauz Khas** — Multi-level co-working-space-turned-bar with a massive terrace overlooking the medieval ruins and lake. Cocktails ₹450-600. Gets packed by 9pm on weekends. The rooftop is the real draw.

**Raasta** — Reggae-themed, ₹250-350 beers, laid-back crowd. One of the few places in the village that doesn't try too hard. Good if you want to sit, drink, and talk.

**Imperfecto** — Bohemian decor, sangria pitchers (₹500), and a menu that covers four cuisines. Good for groups. Gets loud after 10pm.

**Summer House** — Rooftop cafe-bar with better food than most village spots. ₹400-600 cocktails. Calmer atmosphere if the lane is too hectic.

For a full walkthrough of the area, see our [pub crawl guide](/delhi/is-there-a-pub-crawl-in-delhi/).

**Getting there:** Hauz Khas metro (Magenta/Yellow Line interchange), then a 10-minute walk or short auto ride.

## Connaught Place

CP's **outer circle — N Block, M Block, and L Block** — is Delhi's most established drinking strip. The crowd is slightly older and better dressed than Hauz Khas, and the venues lean towards cocktail bars and live music lounges.

**Unplugged Courtyard** — Live cover bands (Bollywood, rock, pop) every night. Large courtyard setting. ₹500-800 cocktails. Energetic and loud — come for the music.

**Lord of the Drinks** — Multi-floor venue with different vibes on each level. Rooftop is the best. Beer ₹350-500, cocktails ₹500-700. One of CP's most reliably busy spots.

**Kitty Su** — Inside The Lalit hotel, this is Delhi's most established club. International DJs, bottle service, and a sound system that can rattle your teeth. Cover charge ₹1,500-2,500 on weekends. This is where Delhi's club crowd comes when they want a proper night out.

**The Beer Cafe** — 50+ taps, Indian and international. Casual, no cover, ₹300-500 per pint. Good first or last stop. For more on Delhi's [craft beer scene](/delhi/where-to-drink-craft-beer-in-delhi/), this is a solid starting point.

**Getting there:** Rajiv Chowk metro (Blue/Yellow Line) puts you in the centre of CP.

## Cyber Hub — Gurgaon

If you're staying near the airport or in Gurgaon, **DLF Cyber Hub** in Sector 24-25 is the night out you want. It's a purpose-built dining and drinking complex — clean, well-lit, safe, and open later than most Delhi venues.

**Soi 7** — Thai-inspired pub with creative cocktails (₹500-700) and a lively weekend crowd.

**The Wine Company** — Extensive wine list, ₹600-1,200 per glass. Quieter, date-friendly.

**Farzi Cafe** — Molecular gastronomy cocktails and inventive bar snacks. ₹600-900 cocktails. More Instagram than substance, but fun for one round.

**Getting there:** HUDA City Centre metro (Yellow Line) then a short auto, or cab from central Delhi (45-60 minutes).

## Aerocity

The **Worldmark complex** near the airport has bars inside five-star hotels and a few standalone restaurants. This is corporate Delhi drinking — polished, expensive, and open later than the rest of the city (some hotel bars serve until 2-3am).

**Yauatcha** — Dim sum and cocktails, upscale, ₹700-1,000 drinks.

**Punjab Grill** — Whisky-focused with 100+ single malts. ₹800-2,000 per pour.

Good for a nightcap if you're catching an early flight. Not worth the trip from central Delhi just for drinks.

## Live Music

Beyond Unplugged Courtyard, Delhi has a small but dedicated live music scene:

**The Piano Man Jazz Club** — Safdarjung Enclave. Jazz, blues, and soul. Intimate 60-seat venue with quality acts. Cover ₹500-1,000 including one drink. Check their Instagram for schedules. Nearest metro: Green Park (Yellow Line).

**BluFrog** (if operational) — Check current status. Previously Delhi's best live music venue in Mehrauli.

**Turquoise Cottage** — Adchini, near IIT Delhi. Rock and indie bands. ₹200-400 cover. Grungy, authentic, and popular with the university crowd.

## Practical Information

**Closing time:** 1:00am in Delhi. Some Gurgaon venues push to 2-3am. Hotel bars technically serve residents later.

**Stag entry:** Many clubs charge men ₹1,000-2,000 cover on weekends if they're not accompanied by women. Couples and groups face no issues. It's a Delhi quirk — frustrating but standard.

**Dress code:** Smart casual is the minimum. No flip-flops, no shorts, no sleeveless shirts for men. Women face virtually no restrictions. Aerocity and five-star hotel bars are stricter.

**Prices:** Budget ₹2,000-4,000 ($24-48) per person for an evening of 4-5 drinks plus a snack or two. Delhi isn't cheap for drinking — alcohol taxes add 25-30% to base prices.

**Drinking age:** 25 in Delhi (legally). Some places check ID, most don't if you look old enough.

**Getting home:** Book Uber or Ola by 12:30am. Surge pricing spikes after 1am. Metro stops running at 11pm.
