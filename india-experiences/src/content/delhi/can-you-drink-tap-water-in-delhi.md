  - question: "Is restaurant water safe to drink in Delhi?"
    answer: "At sit-down restaurants, yes — most use RO (reverse osmosis) filtration systems and the water is safe. Look for restaurants that serve water from a branded RO dispenser or sealed bottles. At street stalls and very basic dhabas, the water source is less certain. Ask for a sealed bottle or carry your own. If a restaurant brings you an opened bottle of water that doesn't have an intact seal, send it back."
  - question: "Is ice safe in Delhi restaurants?"
    answer: "In proper restaurants and cafes, ice is generally made from RO-filtered water and is safe. At street stalls, juice carts, and roadside lassi shops, the ice often comes from non-filtered sources and should be avoided. A good rule: if the establishment has air conditioning and printed menus, the ice is probably fine. If it's a cart on the sidewalk, skip the ice."
  - question: "What happens if you accidentally drink tap water in Delhi?"
    answer: "You might be fine — not every sip causes illness. But Delhi's tap water can contain bacteria like E. coli, parasites, and heavy metals from aging pipe infrastructure. If you develop diarrhea, stomach cramps, or nausea within 12-48 hours, you likely have traveller's diarrhea (Delhi belly). Stay hydrated with clean water and ORS sachets, and see a doctor if symptoms last more than 2-3 days or include fever."

**No — never drink tap water in Delhi.** The water supply is treated at the source, but the pipe network is old, leaky, and prone to contamination. Even most Delhi residents don't drink straight from the tap. Stick to sealed bottled water, RO-filtered water from restaurants, or water you've purified yourself.

## Why Delhi's Tap Water Isn't Safe

Delhi's water comes from the Yamuna River and is treated at plants like Wazirabad and Chandrawal before distribution. The treatment itself meets standards. The problem is what happens after — the city's distribution network includes pipes that are decades old, with cracks, low pressure zones, and sections that run alongside sewage lines. Contamination enters the water between the plant and your tap.

Tests routinely find elevated levels of coliform bacteria, E. coli, and occasionally heavy metals in Delhi's tap water at the point of delivery. The risk is real, and locals know it — that's why almost every Delhi household has an RO water purifier.

## What's Safe to Drink

### Sealed Bottled Water

Your most reliable option. Buy bottles with the **ISI mark** and always check the seal before drinking — refilled bottles sold at inflated prices near tourist spots are a known issue. Press the cap; if it clicks or the seal ring is broken, hand it back.

Common reliable brands: **Bisleri**, **Kinley** (Coca-Cola), **Aquafina** (Pepsi). A 1-litre bottle costs ₹20 ($0.25) at a regular shop, ₹40-80 at tourist sites.

**Buy in bulk.** Pick up a pack of six bottles from a convenience store near your hotel. You'll go through 2-3 litres per day, especially in warm months.

### RO-Filtered Water in Restaurants

Any decent sit-down restaurant in Delhi uses an RO (reverse osmosis) system. The water they serve in glasses or jugs from these systems is safe. If you see a branded water purifier (Kent, Aquaguard, Pureit) behind the counter, you're fine.

At street-level dhabas and very basic eateries, ask: "RO water hai?" If they nod at a visible purifier, you're good. If they point at a matka (clay pot), that's just stored tap water — skip it.

### Water at Your Hotel

Most hotels above the budget tier provide complimentary bottled water or have RO systems. Always check. Even in mid-range hotels, brushing your teeth with tap water carries some risk if you're prone to stomach issues. Use bottled water for brushing if you want to be cautious.

## What's NOT Safe

### Tap Water Anywhere

Not in hotels, not in restaurants, not in fancy-looking offices. If it came from a tap and wasn't filtered through an RO system, don't drink it. This includes water from bathroom sinks in hotels.

### Ice from Street Stalls

The juice wallah at Chandni Chowk makes a killer sugarcane juice, but the block of ice he uses was likely made from unfiltered water and transported in the open. Avoid ice at street stalls, roadside juice carts, and basic lassi shops.

**Exception:** Ice in proper restaurants, cafes, and bars is made from filtered water. If the place has air conditioning and a printed menu, the ice is almost certainly safe. A bar serving cocktails at Khan Market is not using street ice.

### Refilled Water Bottles

A small but real scam at tourist sites: vendors refill brand-name bottles with tap water and reseal them. Always check that the seal ring is intact and snaps cleanly when you twist the cap. If it opens too easily, the bottle has been tampered with.

## How to Avoid Getting Sick

**Carry a water bottle everywhere.** Dehydration is a bigger daily risk than contamination, especially in Delhi's heat from April to September. Buy a large bottle each morning and refill from your hotel's RO system if possible.

**Skip raw salads.** Lettuce, cucumber, and other raw vegetables in basic restaurants are often washed with tap water. At upscale restaurants with proper kitchens, raw salads are usually fine. On the street, stick to cooked food. Our guide on [Delhi belly and how to avoid it](/delhi/what-is-delhi-belly-and-how-to-avoid-it/) goes into more detail.

**Watch the garnishes.** That mint leaf or lemon wedge on your drink at a street stall was washed in tap water. At a proper restaurant, it's not an issue.

**Bring a SteriPen or water purification tablets as backup.** If you're trekking or heading outside the city where bottled water isn't readily available, UV purifiers or chlorine tablets give you a safety net. For city travel, bottled water is easier and cheaper.

**Be extra careful the first 2-3 days.** Your gut hasn't adjusted yet. Even being slightly cautious early on — choosing restaurants over street stalls, avoiding ice initially, sticking to cooked food — reduces your risk. After a few days, most travellers relax a bit and handle things fine.
