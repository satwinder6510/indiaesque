Delhi is India's capital and its most historically layered city — seven distinct cities built on top of each other over a thousand years, from the Rajput Tomars in the 8th century to Edwin Lutyens' colonial avenues in the 1930s. Every neighbourhood carries a different century's fingerprint, and you can cross 500 years of architecture in a single auto-rickshaw ride. This is not a city you "do" in a day, though you can certainly try.

This guide covers the best things to do in Delhi in 2026, with current prices in INR, specific recommendations, and practical transport details. Use it as your starting point, then drill into the category pages below for deeper coverage.

## Food & Drink

Delhi's food scene runs on two parallel tracks. The first is Old Delhi — a 400-year-old walled city where families have been making the same kebabs, parathas, and jalebis for six or seven generations. Chandni Chowk alone has more food history per square metre than most cities. The second track is modern Delhi: the restaurants, cafes, and craft beer bars that have made the city India's most exciting dining destination.

Start with a [food tour through Old Delhi](/delhi/food-tours/). Most tours meet near Chandni Chowk or Chawri Bazaar metro station and cover 8-12 stops over 3-4 hours. You'll eat at places that have been operating since the Mughal era — the parathas at Paranthe Wali Gali, kebabs at Karim's near Jama Masjid, and nihari at places that don't have signboards. Group tours cost ₹1,500-3,500 ($18-42) per person, and the food is included.

If you care about [what food Delhi is famous for](/delhi/what-food-is-delhi-famous-for/), the short answer is: butter chicken (invented at Moti Mahal in Daryaganj in the 1950s), chole bhature, kebabs, biryani, chaat, and parathas. Delhi is also where the tandoori chicken as you know it was popularised, brought by Punjabi refugees after Partition in 1947.

For sit-down restaurants, the range is enormous. You can eat a full thali at a Karol Bagh dhaba for ₹150 ($2) or spend ₹5,000+ ($60+) at Indian Accent in The Lodhi hotel. The [best cafes in Delhi](/delhi/best-cafes-in-delhi/) cluster around Hauz Khas Village, Khan Market, and Champa Gali in Saket — a narrow lane of converted warehouses that now houses coffee roasters and bistros.

Craft beer arrived in Delhi properly around 2018, and the scene has exploded. Gurugram (Gurgaon) has the highest concentration of microbreweries, but South Delhi has solid options too. Check our guide to [craft beer in Delhi](/delhi/where-to-drink-craft-beer-in-delhi/) for specific recommendations.

## Heritage & History

Delhi has 174 monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India — more than most countries have in total. Three of those are UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and the Qutub Minar complex. But the real discovery is the hundreds of lesser-known ruins scattered through residential neighbourhoods, parks, and even roundabouts.

Our [heritage walks guide](/delhi/heritage-walks/) covers four main circuits: the Old Delhi Mughal route (Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk), the Mehrauli circuit (Qutub Minar, Mehrauli Archaeological Park, Jamali Kamali Mosque), the Lodhi/New Delhi route (Humayun's Tomb, Lodhi Gardens, Safdarjung's Tomb), and the Nizamuddin circuit (Nizamuddin Dargah, Sunder Nursery, Humayun's Tomb — yes, it connects to two walks).

If you want to understand Delhi's layered history, start with the [seven cities of Delhi](/delhi/what-are-the-7-cities-of-delhi/). Each city was built by a different dynasty in a different location, and the ruins of all seven are still standing. You can visit five of them in a single day if you have a car and get an early start.

Guided heritage walks run ₹500-2,500 ($6-30) per person depending on group size and guide quality. INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) runs excellent weekend walks. Self-guided walks are completely free — download offline Google Maps and go.

Entry fees are reasonable. Indian nationals pay ₹20-50 at most ASI monuments; foreign tourists pay ₹200-600 ($2.50-7.50). Humayun's Tomb is ₹600 ($7.50) for foreigners, Red Fort is ₹600 ($7.50), and Qutub Minar is ₹600 ($7.50). Combined, you'll spend under ₹2,000 ($25) on entry fees for the big three.

## Markets & Shopping

Delhi's markets are as old as its monuments. Chandni Chowk, the main commercial artery of Old Delhi, was designed by Jahanara Begum (Shah Jahan's daughter) in 1650. It's still operating — just with more motorcycle traffic.

The [markets and shopping guide](/delhi/markets-shopping/) breaks down what each market sells and how to get there by metro. Chandni Chowk is best for textiles, wedding shopping, spices (especially the Khari Baoli spice market, Asia's largest), and electronics at Gaffar Market. Khan Market is Delhi's most expensive retail stretch — books at Bahrisons and Full Circle, boutique clothing, and international brands. Sarojini Nagar is where Delhi's college students buy fast fashion for ₹100-500 ($1-6) per piece.

[Dilli Haat](/delhi/what-is-dilli-haat/) at INA metro station is the most tourist-friendly option — a government-run open-air market with handicraft stalls from every Indian state, fixed (ish) prices, and food counters. Entry is ₹30 ($0.35). It's the easiest place to buy souvenirs without the chaos of a street market.

Bargaining is expected in street markets. Start at 40-50% of the asking price and settle around 60-70%. Fixed-price shops, malls, and Khan Market don't bargain. Check our [bargaining guide](/delhi/is-bargaining-expected-in-delhi-markets/) for specific tactics.

## Unique Experiences

Delhi has more to offer than monuments and food. Some of the best experiences here are the ones that don't show up on standard tourist itineraries.

[Cooking classes](/delhi/best-cooking-classes-in-delhi/) are the standout. The best ones take you to a local market first to buy ingredients, then into someone's home kitchen where you cook 4-5 dishes — dal, a vegetable curry, a bread, a meat dish if you eat it, and dessert. You sit down and eat what you've made. These cost ₹2,000-5,000 ($25-60) and typically run 4-5 hours. They're the single best value experience in Delhi.

Early morning cycling tours through Old Delhi are surreal — you ride through Chandni Chowk before the crowds arrive, weave through the lanes behind Jama Masjid, and stop for chai and parathas. Delhi By Cycle pioneered this format. Tours start at 6:00-6:30am and cost ₹1,500-2,000 ($18-25).

The [Lodhi Art District](/delhi/where-to-see-street-art-in-delhi/) is a kilometre of street art along Lodhi Road, between Lodhi Gardens and Khanna Market. International and Indian artists have covered walls, pillars, and entire building facades. It's free, it's outdoors, and it's best photographed in morning light.

Thursday evenings at Nizamuddin Dargah are something else entirely. Qawwali singers perform Sufi devotional music at the shrine of the 14th-century saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. It's free, open to all faiths, and genuinely moving. Get there by 7pm for a good spot. Read more in our [experiences guide](/delhi/experiences/).

## Day Trips From Delhi

Delhi's location makes it a natural base for day trips. The [day trips guide](/delhi/day-trips/) covers each option in detail, but here's the summary.

**Agra and the Taj Mahal** is the most popular day trip. The Gatimaan Express leaves Hazrat Nizamuddin station at 6:10am and reaches Agra in 1 hour 40 minutes. You'll have enough time for the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort before catching the 5:50pm return train. By car via the Yamuna Expressway, it's 3-4 hours each way. Read the full [Delhi to Agra day trip guide](/delhi/can-you-do-a-day-trip-from-delhi-to-agra/).

**Neemrana Fort Palace** is a 15th-century fort converted into a heritage hotel, about 2 hours southwest of Delhi on the Jaipur highway. You can visit for lunch (buffet around ₹2,000/$25 per person), swim in the stepped pool, and do a zip-line across the ramparts. It's the best half-day getaway from the city.

**Jaipur** is technically possible as a day trip (5-6 hours by road, 4.5 hours by Shatabdi Express), but you'll spend more time travelling than sightseeing. We recommend at least one night. The [Delhi to Jaipur guide](/delhi/can-you-do-a-day-trip-from-delhi-to-jaipur/) explains the logistics.

**Mathura and Vrindavan**, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, is 3 hours south. The temples are spectacular — Banke Bihari Temple in Vrindavan and the Krishna Janmabhoomi complex in Mathura. Visit during Holi (February/March) if you want the most intense colour festival in India.

## Practical Information

### Best Time To Visit Delhi

**October to March** is the sweet spot. Temperatures hover between 10-25°C during the day, and the air quality improves after mid-January. November and February are ideal months.

**April to June** is punishing. Temperatures hit 42-47°C in May and June. If you're visiting in summer, plan indoor activities for midday and sightsee early morning or after 4pm. Our guide to [things to do in Delhi in summer](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-in-summer/) covers heat-proof options.

**July to September** is monsoon. Humidity is high, rain comes in heavy bursts, and some low-lying areas flood. The upside: everything is green, tourist sites are empty, and hotel prices drop 30-50%.

**Air quality** is worst from late October to mid-December, when crop-burning smoke from Punjab and Haryana blankets the city. If you're sensitive to pollution, check AQI readings daily and carry an N95 mask. Read our [Delhi pollution guide](/delhi/is-delhi-polluted/) for more.

### Getting To Delhi

Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) is Delhi's sole airport and India's busiest. Terminal 3 handles most international flights.

**Airport to city centre:**

- **Airport Express Metro:** ₹60 ($0.75), 20 minutes to New Delhi Railway Station. Runs 5am-11pm. Clean, fast, no traffic. Best option for most travellers.
- **Uber / Ola:** ₹300-500 ($4-6) to Connaught Place, 30-90 minutes depending on traffic. Book from the app after crossing the arrivals gate.
- **Prepaid taxi:** ₹400-600 ($5-7.50) from the counter inside arrivals. Slower than metro but door-to-door.
- **Delhi Metro (non-express):** Possible but involves a transfer at Dhaula Kuan. Not worth it unless your hotel is on the Magenta Line.

See the full breakdown in [how to get from Delhi airport to the city](/delhi/how-do-i-get-from-delhi-airport-to-the-city/).

### Getting Around Delhi

**Delhi Metro** is the backbone. It's clean, safe, air-conditioned, and covers most tourist areas. Fares run ₹10-60 depending on distance. Buy a Tourist Card (₹200 for one day, ₹500 for three days, unlimited rides) at any station. See our [Delhi Metro guide](/delhi/how-to-use-delhi-metro/) for route tips.

**Uber and Ola** work everywhere and are cheap by international standards. A 10km ride costs ₹150-250 ($2-3). Both apps accept international credit cards and cash. Rides are GPS-tracked, which adds safety.

**Auto-rickshaws** are the classic Delhi experience. Always agree on a fare before getting in, or insist on the meter (though many drivers will refuse). A 5km auto ride should cost ₹50-80. Google Maps can give you a fare estimate.

**Walking** is viable only within specific areas — Connaught Place, Lodhi Gardens, Old Delhi lanes, Hauz Khas Village. Between areas, the distances and traffic make walking impractical.

### Where To Stay In Delhi

**Connaught Place / New Delhi:** Central, well-connected by metro (Rajiv Chowk station), close to India Gate and Jantar Mantar. Mid-range to luxury hotels. Best for first-timers. Hotels: ₹3,000-25,000 ($35-300) per night.

**Karol Bagh:** Budget to mid-range, good metro access (Karol Bagh station on Blue Line), plenty of restaurants and shops. Less polished than CP but more affordable. Hotels: ₹1,200-5,000 ($15-60) per night. See [things to do in Karol Bagh](/delhi/things-to-do-in-karol-bagh/).

**South Delhi (Hauz Khas, Defence Colony, Greater Kailash):** Where Delhi's restaurants, bars, and boutiques cluster. Quieter than central Delhi, good metro connections on the Yellow and Magenta lines. Hotels and Airbnbs: ₹2,500-15,000 ($30-180) per night.

**Paharganj:** The backpacker strip, directly opposite New Delhi Railway Station. Cheap hotels from ₹500 ($6), but gritty, loud, and full of touts. Fine for one night if you have an early train. Read [Paharganj — is it worth staying?](/delhi/paharganj-is-it-worth-staying/) before you book.

**Near the airport (Aerocity):** Corporate hotels along the Airport Express Metro line. Good if you have a late arrival or early departure. No character, but reliable. Hotels: ₹4,000-20,000 ($50-240) per night.

### Budget Breakdown

**Budget (₹2,000-3,000 / $25-35 per day):** Hostel dorm or basic guesthouse (₹500-1,000), street food and dhabas (₹300-500), metro and auto-rickshaws (₹200-300), entry fees (₹200-600), SIM card and data (₹300 one-time).
