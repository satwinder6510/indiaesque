  - question: "What can you do in Delhi at night?"
    answer: "Visit illuminated India Gate, eat dinner along Connaught Place's inner circle, bar-hop in Hauz Khas Village, take an Old Delhi night food walk, or catch Akshardham Temple's fountain show at sunset. Most nightlife areas stay active until 1am. Night food walks in Old Delhi run from 7-10pm."
  - question: "Is it safe to go out at night in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, in the right areas. South Delhi (Hauz Khas, Defence Colony, Khan Market), Connaught Place's inner circle, and Aerocity are safe and well-lit after dark. Stick to busy areas, use Uber or Ola for transport, and avoid isolated stretches. Old Delhi lanes shut down after 9pm and are best avoided late at night."
  - question: "What time is the Akshardham fountain show?"
    answer: "The Akshardham Yagna Purush Kund musical fountain show runs daily except Mondays, starting after sunset — around 6:15pm in winter and 7:15pm in summer. The show lasts 25 minutes. It's free but you need an exhibition ticket (₹170 adults, ₹100 children) to access the area. Arrive 30 minutes early for good seats."

**Delhi comes alive after dark in a completely different way — India Gate glows under floodlights, Connaught Place turns into a dinner-and-drinks circuit, and the food stalls of Old Delhi fire up for the evening rush.** The city's nighttime personality is warmer, cooler (literally, in summer), and often more interesting than daytime.

You have roughly a 6pm-1am window. Metro runs until 11pm, bars close at 1am, and the best food happens between 7-10pm. Here's how to fill those hours.

## Akshardham Fountain Show

Start your evening here if you can. The **Yagna Purush Kund** musical fountain show at Akshardham Temple is a 25-minute spectacle of water jets, fire, lasers, and projection set to music. It's surprisingly good — theatrical, colourful, and unlike anything else in Delhi.

**Timing:** Daily except Mondays. Starts after sunset — around 6:15pm (winter) or 7:15pm (summer).
**Cost:** Free with exhibition ticket (₹170 adults, ₹100 children).
**Getting there:** Akshardham metro (Blue Line), 5-minute walk.

Arrive 30 minutes early. Seating is first-come, and the centre rows fill fast. No phones or cameras inside the complex — leave them in the lockers at the entrance.

## India Gate After Dark

India Gate is dramatically floodlit from dusk until midnight. The wide lawns around it fill with families, ice cream vendors, and couples on evening walks. It's free, open, and one of Delhi's few genuinely enjoyable late-evening outdoor spaces.

Walk the Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath) from India Gate towards Rashtrapati Bhavan — the whole stretch is lit up and the buildings look grand in the evening light. Street food vendors set up along the edge selling chaat, corn, and kulfi.

**Getting there:** Central Secretariat metro (Yellow/Violet Line), then 15-minute walk or short auto.

## Connaught Place Dinner Circuit

CP's inner circle is Delhi's original eating-and-drinking strip, and it's at its best from 7-11pm. The white Georgian columns are illuminated, the restaurants are open-fronted, and the circular arcade has a buzzy atmosphere that central Delhi otherwise lacks.

**Where to eat:**
- **Farzi Cafe** — Inventive Indian small plates. ₹1,500-2,500 per person.
- **Nizam's** — No-frills Mughlai. Seekh kebab rolls for ₹150-200.
- **Wenger's** — Bakery since 1926. Grab a pastry for ₹60-150 after dinner.
- **Kwality** — Old-school North Indian restaurant since 1940. Butter chicken ₹500, naan ₹80.

Walk from **Rajiv Chowk metro** (Blue/Yellow Line). For the full drinking scene here, see our [nightlife guide](/delhi/best-nightlife-in-delhi/).

## Old Delhi Night Food Walk

The lanes around **Jama Masjid** and **Matia Mahal** don't follow the same schedule as the rest of Old Delhi. While Chandni Chowk shuts by 8pm, the food stalls south of Jama Masjid fire up for the evening crowd. This is where you eat Delhi's best nihari (slow-cooked meat stew), kebabs, and phirni (rice pudding).

**Key stops:**
- **Al Jawahar** — Opposite Jama Masjid Gate 1. Nihari and biryani. Open until 11pm.
- **Karim's** — Down Matia Mahal lane. Delhi's most famous Mughlai restaurant. Seekh kebabs and mutton burra.
- **Kallu Nihari** — Tiny stall near Gate 3. The nihari is outstanding. Open evenings only.

Go with a guide or on a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) — evening walking tours in Old Delhi run 7-10pm and cover 5-7 stops for ₹2,000-3,500 per person. The lanes are narrow and confusing after dark, and a guide knows which stalls are open when.

For safety considerations in Old Delhi at night, check our [safety guide](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-at-night/). The main food lanes near Jama Masjid stay busy and well-lit until 10-11pm.

## Hauz Khas Village Nightlife

From 9pm onwards, Hauz Khas Village is where young Delhi goes to drink. The narrow lane packs 15+ bars and restaurants vertically — ground floor, first floor, rooftop — and the energy builds as the night goes on.

Start at **Social** for rooftop cocktails with views over the lake and medieval ruins. Move to **Raasta** for reggae and cheap beer. End wherever the crowd takes you. Everything closes at 1am.

**Getting there:** Hauz Khas metro (Magenta/Yellow Line interchange), 10-minute walk.

## Cultural Evenings

### India Habitat Centre

The IHC on Lodhi Road hosts concerts, theatre, film screenings, and lectures most evenings. Check their monthly calendar at **indiahabitat.org**. Events range from free gallery openings to ticketed classical music performances (₹200-500). It's where Delhi's intellectual and cultural crowd gathers.

**Nearest metro:** JLN Stadium (Violet Line), 10-minute auto ride.

### Dilli Haat

An open-air crafts bazaar at INA that stays open until 10pm. Handicraft stalls from every Indian state, plus food stalls serving regional cuisine. Entry ₹30. It's tourist-friendly but well-done. Good for an early-evening browse and dinner.

**Nearest metro:** INA (Yellow/Pink Line).

### Qawwali at Nizamuddin

Thursday evenings bring free qawwali at Nizamuddin Dargah, starting around 6:30pm. It's one of Delhi's most powerful experiences — live devotional Sufi music in a 14th-century shrine courtyard. Not a tourist show. Go with respect and an open mind.

## Practical Tips

**Metro closes at 11pm.** If you're out later, you'll need Uber, Ola, or an auto-rickshaw. Book a cab by 12:30am — surge pricing hits hard after bars close at 1am.

**Carry cash.** Street food vendors, auto drivers, and some smaller bars are cash-only. ₹2,000 in small notes gets you through an evening.

**Mosquitoes.** October-November evenings bring mosquitoes, especially near parks and water. Carry repellent if you're spending time outdoors.

**Winter evenings are the best.** December and January nights drop to 5-8°C — chilly by Delhi standards, but perfect for walking, eating, and sitting on rooftops. Bring a jacket.
