  - question: "Which Delhi neighbourhood has the best street food?"
    answer: "Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi, without question. The lanes between Chandni Chowk metro station and Jama Masjid hold the highest concentration of historic street food stalls in the city — Paranthe Wali Gali (parathas since the 1870s), Natraj (dahi bhalle since the 1940s), Old Famous Jalebi Wala, and dozens of unnamed chaat, kebab, and sweet shops. No other area comes close for variety and history."
  - question: "Where should I eat if I'm staying in South Delhi?"
    answer: "Defence Colony market has a strong mix of modern Indian restaurants and street food stalls. Khan Market is nearby for upscale dining. CR Park (Chittaranjan Park) is Delhi's Bengali neighbourhood with excellent fish curry, momos, and sweets. Hauz Khas Village has cafes and bars with lakeside views. For a quick meal, SDA Market (near IIT Delhi) has cheap, reliable student-budget food."
  - question: "Is there good food near India Gate and central Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Connaught Place (Rajiv Chowk metro) is a 10-minute walk from India Gate and has restaurants across all budgets — from Wenger's bakery (since 1926) to Indian Coffee House to high-end options like Farzi Cafe. Khan Market, also central, has Big Chill, Perch, and some of Delhi's best bookshop-cafes. Bengali Market nearby has Nathu's for chaat and sweets."

**Old Delhi's Chandni Chowk has the best street food in Delhi, Nizamuddin is the top area for Mughlai cuisine, Connaught Place leads for sit-down restaurants, and Defence Colony is the strongest South Delhi food neighbourhood.** Each area has a distinct character, and the best approach is to eat in multiple neighbourhoods rather than sticking to one.

## Old Delhi / Chandni Chowk — Street Food Capital

This is where serious eating happens. The lanes between Chandni Chowk metro station and Jama Masjid contain over a century's worth of food stalls, many still run by the same families.

**What to eat:** Parathas at Paranthe Wali Gali (since the 1870s), dahi bhalle at Natraj (since the 1940s), kebabs at Karim's (since 1913), jalebis at Old Famous Jalebi Wala, nihari at Haji Shabrati, and kulfi at Kuremal's in Chawri Bazaar.

**How to get there:** Yellow Line metro to Chandni Chowk station. See our full [Old Delhi eating guide](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/) for a lane-by-lane breakdown.

**Budget:** ₹200-500 ($2.50-6) feeds you extremely well. Most individual items cost ₹30-100.

**Best time:** 10 AM to 2 PM on any day except Tuesday (many shops close).

## Nizamuddin — Mughlai and Sufi Quarter

The neighbourhood around **Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah** is one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas in Delhi. The food here is Mughlai — slow-cooked meats, biryanis, and breads baked in tandoors.

**What to eat:** Mutton biryani and kebabs at the small restaurants lining the lanes leading to the dargah. **Karim's** has a branch here too. The [Nizamuddin area](/delhi/things-to-do-in-nizamuddin/) is also where you'll find some of the best nalli nihari (bone marrow stew) in Delhi.

**How to get there:** JLN Stadium metro (Violet Line), then a short auto ride or 10-minute walk.

**Budget:** ₹200-400 ($2.50-5) per person at most shops.

**Best time:** Thursday evenings are special — qawwali devotional music at the dargah starting around 6:30 PM, and the food stalls are at their busiest.

## Connaught Place (CP) — All-Rounder

Delhi's colonial-era commercial hub has food at every price point. The white colonnaded inner and outer circles contain everything from historic cafes to modern restaurants.

**What to eat:** Coffee and snacks at **Indian Coffee House** (inner circle, since 1957 — politicians and writers still come here). Pastries at **Wenger's** (since 1926). Parsi food at **SodaBottleOpenerWala**. Modern Indian at **Farzi Cafe**. Late-night kebab rolls from the vendors on Janpath.

**How to get there:** Rajiv Chowk metro (Yellow and Blue Line interchange) exits directly into CP.

**Budget:** ₹300-1,500 ($3.60-18) per person depending on the restaurant.

## Khan Market — Upscale Eating

Delhi's most expensive market per square foot also has concentrated good food. Not street food territory — this is restaurants, cafes, and bakeries.

**What to eat:** Italian at **Big Chill**, coffee at **Perch**, modern Indian at **Yum Yum Cha** (dim sum and pan-Asian), and books plus cake at **Full Circle Bookshop Cafe**. **Khan Chacha** does solid kebab rolls from a stall at the front of the market.

**How to get there:** Khan Market metro (Violet Line).

**Budget:** ₹600-1,500 ($7-18) per person at sit-down restaurants.

## Defence Colony — South Delhi's Food Hub

Defence Colony market is where South Delhi locals actually eat. The market has a mix of street food vendors and proper restaurants, and it tends to be less crowded than Khan Market.

**What to eat:** The market's outer ring has excellent momos, chaat, and kebab roll stalls. Inside, restaurants serve everything from Mughlai to Japanese. **Naivedyam** does reliable South Indian thalis.

**How to get there:** Lajpat Nagar metro (Violet Line), then a short auto ride.

**Budget:** ₹200-800 ($2.50-10) per person.

## CR Park — Bengali Colony

Chittaranjan Park is Delhi's Bengali neighbourhood, and the food reflects it. If you want fish curry, mishti doi (sweet yoghurt), or Kolkata-style street food, this is the place.

**What to eat:** Fish fry and fish curry at the market stalls. **Maa Tara** and other sweet shops for rasgulla and sandesh. Bengali thali meals at home-style restaurants. During Durga Puja (October), the entire neighbourhood transforms into a food festival.

**How to get there:** Govind Puri or Harkesh Nagar Okhla metro, then auto.

## Hauz Khas Village — Cafes and Bars

The narrow lanes of Hauz Khas Village overlook a 13th-century reservoir and deer park. The food here leans towards cafes, bars, and modern fusion restaurants rather than traditional Delhi food.

**What to eat:** Coffee at **Kunzum Travel Cafe** (pay what you want), cocktails at several rooftop bars, and various cuisine restaurants. Not the place for street food, but good for a relaxed evening.

**How to get there:** Green Park or Hauz Khas metro (Yellow Line), then auto.

For a [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) that covers the best stalls across areas, start in Old Delhi — that's where the depth is.
