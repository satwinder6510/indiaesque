**Chandni Chowk is the biggest market in Delhi — a 1.5-kilometre stretch of wholesale and retail bazaars that's been in continuous operation since 1650.** It's one of the largest and oldest markets in Asia, with over 400,000 people passing through its lanes every single day.

## The Layout

Chandni Chowk runs east to west from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. The main road is the spine, but the real market lives in the dozens of side lanes branching off it. Each lane — called a gali or katra — specialises in a specific type of goods. This system of specialisation has survived for centuries.

Here's what you'll find in the main sub-markets:

### Khari Baoli — Spices

At the western end of Chandni Chowk, Khari Baoli is Asia's largest spice market. Whole spices, dried fruits, herbs, and nuts are sold in towering sacks. The air here is thick with turmeric, chilli, and cardamom. Prices are wholesale — a fraction of what you'd pay in a supermarket. Read our full guide on [buying spices in Delhi](/delhi/where-to-buy-spices-in-delhi/).

### Dariba Kalan — Silver and Jewellery

One of India's oldest jewellery markets, dating to the Mughal era. Silver jewellery, gold, precious stones, and traditional Indian ornaments. The silver is sold by weight, and prices are fair because competition between shops is fierce.

### Kinari Bazaar — Wedding Supplies

If it sparkles and it's used at an Indian wedding, Kinari Bazaar sells it. Embroidered fabrics, gold-thread trim (kinari), sequined dupattas, decorative items, and costume jewellery. Even if you're not shopping for a wedding, the visual overload is extraordinary.

### Nai Sarak — Books and Stationery

This lane has been Delhi's book market for over a century. Textbooks, competitive exam guides, stationery supplies, and some secondhand books. Not a tourist market, but interesting to walk through.

### Balli Maran — Perfumes

Named after the bamboo-workers who once operated here, Balli Maran is now the centre of Delhi's perfume (attar) trade. Small shops sell concentrated oil-based perfumes in tiny glass bottles. The poet Mirza Ghalib lived on this street — his haveli (house) is preserved as a small museum.

### Chawri Bazaar — Paper and Printing

South of the main Chandni Chowk road, Chawri Bazaar deals in paper products, printing supplies, and brass. The Chawri Bazaar metro station (Yellow Line) drops you right at the edge.

## The Street Food

Chandni Chowk is as much a food destination as a shopping one. The key spots:

- **Paranthe Wali Gali** — a narrow lane of shops frying stuffed paranthas in ghee since the 1870s. ₹80-150 ($1-2) per parantha.
- **Karim's** — near Jama Masjid, serving Mughlai meat dishes since 1913. Mutton korma and seekh kebabs are the signatures. ₹400-600 ($5-7) per person.
- **Natraj Dahi Bhalle** — chaat (savoury snacks) on the main road. Their dahi bhalla (lentil fritters in yogurt) costs ₹80 ($1).
- **Old Famous Jalebi Wala** — a corner shop frying jalebis (syrup-soaked spirals) in a massive kadhai right on the street. ₹50-80 ($0.60-1) per plate.

## Getting There and Around

**Metro**: Yellow Line to **Chandni Chowk station** drops you on the main road. **Chawri Bazaar station** (also Yellow Line) is useful for the southern lanes and Khari Baoli.

**By road**: Don't try to drive in. Traffic inside Old Delhi is chaotic even by Delhi standards. Take a metro or Uber to the nearest station and walk in.

**Getting around inside**: Walk. The lanes are too narrow for cars and most are too narrow for cycle rickshaws. Cycle rickshaws operate on the main Chandni Chowk road and can shuttle you between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid for ₹30-50 ($0.35-0.60).

**Hours**: Most shops open between 10:00 and 11:00 AM. Closing time is around 8:00 PM. The market is **closed on Sundays**.

**Time needed**: 3-5 hours to do a proper walk through the main lanes. Add another hour or two if you want to eat at multiple spots.

## Tips for Visiting

**Go on a weekday.** Saturday is the busiest day. Sunday everything is shuttered. Tuesday through Thursday is optimal.

**Wear comfortable shoes.** You'll walk on uneven surfaces, step over cabling, and navigate stairs in some of the older katras.

**Keep your phone and wallet secure.** The lanes are crowded, and pickpocketing happens. Front pockets or a crossbody bag is your best bet.

**Bargain everywhere.** This is Old Delhi — no one expects you to pay the first price. Start at 50% and negotiate. See our full guide on [bargaining in Delhi](/delhi/is-bargaining-expected-in-delhi-markets/).
