**Diwali in Delhi is an overwhelming sensory experience — millions of oil lamps and candles illuminate homes and markets, fireworks and firecrackers thunder across the city for hours, and the smell of sweets, incense, and gunpowder fills the air.** It's India's biggest festival, and Delhi celebrates it with an intensity that matches its scale as the national capital.

Diwali (the festival of lights) celebrates the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. It falls on the new moon night in the Hindu month of Kartik — usually in October or November. In 2026, Diwali is on Wednesday, 21 October.

For tourists, Diwali in Delhi is spectacular but comes with a significant caveat: air quality. The combination of firecrackers and the onset of winter pollution makes Delhi's air genuinely hazardous for several days around Diwali. More on that below — but first, what makes it worth experiencing.

## The Five Days of Diwali

Diwali isn't a single day. It's a five-day festival, and each day has its own traditions:

### Dhanteras (Day 1) — 19 October 2026

The festival of wealth. People buy gold, silver, and new utensils. Markets are packed with shoppers. Jewellery stores and electronics shops run their biggest sales of the year. If you want to see Delhi's commercial energy at full blast, visit Chandni Chowk or Karol Bagh on Dhanteras.

### Naraka Chaturdashi (Day 2) — 20 October 2026

A smaller celebration. People clean their homes, take oil baths, and prepare for the main event. Markets start getting decorated with lights and garlands.

### Diwali (Day 3) — 21 October 2026

The main event. From late afternoon, families light diyas (oil lamps) outside their doors and on windowsills. Rangoli patterns — colourful designs made from powdered colour, flower petals, or rice — appear on doorsteps and in courtyards. Lakshmi Puja (prayer to the goddess of wealth) happens at dusk.

Then the fireworks begin. And in Delhi, they don't stop for hours.

### Govardhan Puja (Day 4) — 22 October 2026

Families visit temples and share meals. A quieter day. Many people visit relatives and exchange sweets and gifts.

### Bhai Dooj (Day 5) — 23 October 2026

Brothers and sisters celebrate their bond. Similar to Raksha Bandhan but less commercially prominent.

## Where to Experience Diwali in Delhi

### Markets and Shopping Areas

The best way to soak in Diwali's visual energy is to walk through Delhi's decorated markets in the days leading up to and including Diwali:

**Chandni Chowk** — Old Delhi's main bazaar goes all out. Every lane is strung with lights, and shops spill over with Diwali merchandise: diyas, candles, decorative lights, sweets, dry fruits, and puja supplies. The [markets of Delhi](/delhi/what-are-the-best-markets-in-delhi/) are at their most electric during Diwali week.

**Sarojini Nagar Market** — known for clothes and accessories, Sarojini Nagar during Diwali is packed with shoppers buying new outfits (wearing new clothes on Diwali is a tradition). The market's narrow lanes become a sea of people.

**Dilli Haat** — the open-air crafts market hosts special Diwali-themed stalls with regional handicrafts, lamps, and decorations. A calmer alternative to the chaos of Chandni Chowk.

**Khan Market and Select Citywalk** — the upscale end of Diwali. Beautifully decorated, with gourmet sweet boxes and designer diyas. Good for Diwali gift shopping without the crowd crush.

### Temple Visits

**Akshardham Temple** — puts on a special light show during Diwali week. The temple complex is illuminated, and the musical fountain show adds to the atmosphere.

**Lakshmi Narayan Temple (Birla Mandir)** — dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi, this is one of the most visited temples during Diwali. Expect long queues on Diwali evening but a genuinely spiritual atmosphere.

**ISKCON Temple** — holds elaborate Diwali celebrations with kirtan (devotional singing), aarti (ritual prayer), and distribution of prasad (blessed food). The temple is beautifully decorated.

**Chhatarpur Temple** — one of the largest temple complexes in Delhi, it's spectacular when fully illuminated during Diwali.

### Residential Areas

Some of the most charming Diwali experiences are in residential neighbourhoods. Defence Colony, CR Park (home to Delhi's Bengali community, which celebrates Kali Puja on Diwali night), and South Extension residential lanes are beautifully decorated. Walking through these areas after dark, when every doorstep has glowing diyas and rangoli, is genuinely magical.

## Shopping for Diwali

If you want to bring home Diwali items:

- **Diyas (oil lamps)** — available everywhere from ₹5-50 ($0.06-0.60) each. The painted and decorative ones from Dilli Haat make excellent souvenirs.
- **Candles and lanterns** — paper lanterns (akash kandils) are sold at every market. They fold flat and are easy to carry home.
- **Sweets** — Diwali sweet boxes are given as gifts. Famous shops include Haldiram's, Bikanervala, and Bengali Market's Nathu's. A nice box costs ₹500-2,000 ($6-24). Kaju katli (cashew fudge), gulab jamun, and motichoor laddoo are the classics.
- **Dry fruits** — decorative dry fruit boxes are another traditional Diwali gift. Available at Old Delhi's Khari Baoli spice market and at shops across the city.

## The Air Quality Issue

This is the honest part. Delhi's air quality during Diwali is terrible, and you need to prepare for it.

Despite a Supreme Court ban on firecrackers in Delhi (reiterated annually), enforcement is minimal. On Diwali night, millions of firecrackers go off across the city. The AQI (Air Quality Index) typically spikes to 400-500+ — well into "hazardous" territory. The smoke combines with the beginning of winter's temperature inversion, trapping pollutants close to the ground.

The morning after Diwali, you'll see a thick grey haze over the city. Visibility drops, your throat may feel scratchy, and the smell of spent firecrackers lingers. This elevated pollution persists for 3-5 days.

**What to do about it:**

- Bring an **N95 mask** and wear it outdoors on Diwali night and the following 2-3 days. For more on [Delhi's pollution](/delhi/is-delhi-polluted/), see our detailed guide.
- Keep your hotel room windows closed. Request a room with an air purifier if possible.
- If you have asthma or respiratory issues, consider experiencing the daytime celebrations (market visits, temple trips) and staying indoors during the evening firecracker hours.
- Monitor air quality on the IQAir app or aqicn.org. If the AQI is above 300, limit outdoor exposure.

The air quality shouldn't necessarily stop you from visiting during Diwali — the cultural experience is extraordinary — but go in with eyes open and N95 masks packed.

## The Sound

Diwali in Delhi is loud. Extremely loud. Firecrackers start around 5 PM and continue past midnight. If you're sensitive to noise, bring earplugs. Hotel rooms in central Delhi will vibrate with the sound. By around 1 AM, things usually quiet down, but expect interruptions throughout the night.

## Practical Tips for Tourists

- **Book accommodation early** — Diwali is a major domestic travel period. Hotel prices rise 30-50% and rooms fill up, especially in popular tourist areas. Book at least 6 weeks in advance.
- **Many businesses close** — on Diwali day itself, most shops and restaurants close by early afternoon. Plan your meals around hotel restaurants or order food in advance.
- **Dress up** — Diwali is a dress-up occasion. Wearing Indian ethnic clothes (kurta-pyjama for men, salwar kameez or saree for women) will earn you smiles and compliments. Delhi's markets sell affordable options.
- **Be ready for fireworks at close range** — firecrackers go off on streets, in parking lots, and on rooftops. Keep your distance, watch where you walk, and be prepared for sudden loud bangs.

## When Is Diwali in 2026?

Diwali in 2026 falls on Wednesday, 21 October. The main celebrations happen on the evening and night of 21 October, but the broader Diwali festival spans five days — from Dhanteras (19 October) through Bhai Dooj (23 October). Markets and homes begin decorating at least a week before.

## Is Delhi's Air Quality Bad During Diwali?

Yes, Delhi's air quality gets significantly worse during Diwali despite ongoing firecracker bans. The AQI (Air Quality Index) routinely spikes above 400-500 on Diwali night and the following day, which is classified as 'severe' and 'hazardous.' Bring an N95 mask, keep hotel windows closed, and consider staying indoors on the night of Diwali if you have respiratory issues.
