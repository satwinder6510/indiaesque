**Delhi has over 50 museums, but five stand out: the National Museum (free entry, enormous collection), the National Gallery of Modern Art, the Partition Museum, the Crafts Museum, and Gandhi Smriti.** These five cover Indian history from the Indus Valley to 1947, modern art, traditional crafts, and one of the most emotionally powerful stories of the 20th century.

## National Museum

The National Museum on Janpath Road is India's largest museum and one of the best in Asia. Entry became free in 2023, making it one of Delhi's top [free things to do](/delhi/best-free-things-to-do-in-delhi/). The collection spans 5,000 years — Indus Valley terracottas, Gandhara Buddhist sculptures, Chola bronzes, Mughal miniature paintings, Rajasthani textiles, Central Asian antiquities, and a dedicated arms and armour gallery.

The standout sections are the Harappan gallery (2600-1900 BC artefacts from Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, including the famous Dancing Girl replica), the Buddhist art gallery (stunning Gandhara sculptures showing Greek influence on Indian art), and the manuscript gallery with illuminated Mughal and Persian texts.

**Be selective.** The museum has 200,000 objects across three floors. Trying to see everything in one visit is exhausting and counterproductive. Pick two or three galleries that interest you and spend an hour in each.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: Free
- Hours: 10 AM to 6 PM, closed Mondays
- Location: Janpath Road, near India Gate
- Metro: Udyog Bhawan (Yellow Line), 10-minute walk east
- Time needed: 2-3 hours (selective visit)

## National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA)

India's premier modern art museum, housed in the former Delhi residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur near India Gate. The collection covers Indian art from the 1850s onward — Bengal School, Progressive Artists' Group, contemporary installations.

The star works include pieces by Amrita Sher-Gil (India's Frida Kahlo), Raja Ravi Varma (the painter who defined how Indians visualise their mythology), MF Husain, SH Raza, and Tyeb Mehta. The permanent collection is strong, but check what temporary exhibitions are running — the NGMA regularly hosts major shows.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: ₹20 ($0.25) Indians, ₹500 ($6) foreigners
- Hours: 10 AM to 5 PM, closed Mondays
- Location: Jaipur House, near India Gate
- Metro: Central Secretariat (Yellow/Violet Line), 15-minute walk
- Time needed: 1.5-2 hours

## Partition Museum (at Town Hall, Daryaganj)

The Delhi Partition Museum (also called the Museum of the People, Virasat-e-Khalsa annex) documents the 1947 Partition of British India into India and Pakistan — one of the largest mass migrations in human history. Roughly 15 million people were displaced and up to 2 million killed in the communal violence.

The museum uses personal testimonies, photographs, household objects, and oral histories to tell stories from both sides of the border. Display cases hold items that refugees carried with them — a sewing machine, a set of keys to a house they'd never return to, family photographs. It's emotionally intense and historically vital.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: ₹10-50 ($0.10-0.60)
- Hours: 10 AM to 5 PM, closed Mondays
- Location: Daryaganj area, Old Delhi
- Metro: Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line) or Delhi Gate (Violet Line)
- Time needed: 1-2 hours

## Crafts Museum

Officially called the National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, this is one of Delhi's most enjoyable and least crowded museums. The collection covers India's textile, craft, and folk art traditions — pottery, weaving, wood carving, metalwork, embroidery, tribal art. The outdoor village complex recreates traditional houses from different Indian states, built using authentic materials and techniques.

What makes it special is that working artisans are often on-site, demonstrating their craft. You might see a block printer from Rajasthan, a weaver from West Bengal, or a potter from Uttar Pradesh working in the courtyard. You can buy directly from them.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: Free
- Hours: 10 AM to 5 PM, closed Mondays
- Location: Bhairon Marg, near Pragati Maidan
- Metro: Pragati Maidan (Blue Line), 10-minute walk
- Time needed: 1-1.5 hours

## Gandhi Smriti

The house where Mahatma Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life, and where he was assassinated on January 30, 1948. The room where he slept and the prayer ground where he was shot are preserved exactly as they were. A series of panels and photographs trace Gandhi's life, philosophy, and the events leading to Partition and independence.

The path Gandhi walked from the house to the prayer ground, where Nathuram Godse shot him, is marked with concrete footsteps. The spot where he fell is marked by a simple memorial. It's a quiet, reflective place in a city that's rarely quiet.

**Practical details:**
- Entry: Free
- Hours: 10 AM to 5 PM, closed Mondays and second Saturdays
- Location: 5, Tees January Marg (previously Albuquerque Road)
- Metro: Race Course (now Lok Kalyan Marg, Yellow Line), 5-minute walk
- Time needed: 45 minutes to 1 hour

## Other Museums Worth Considering

**National Rail Museum** — In Chanakyapuri, with 33 life-sized vintage locomotives and coaches, including a 1855 steam engine. A toy train circles the park. Great for families. ₹50 entry.

**National Science Centre** — Near Pragati Maidan, with interactive exhibits on physics, human biology, and emerging technology. Best for kids. ₹80 entry.

**Air Force Museum** — In Palam, near the airport. Open-air display of fighter jets, helicopters, and missiles. Free entry but requires ID.

**Shankar's International Dolls Museum** — Near ITO, with over 6,500 dolls from 85 countries. Niche but charming. ₹25 entry.

## Planning a Museum Day

Delhi museums are ideal for days when it's too hot, too smoky, or too rainy for outdoor sightseeing — see our guide on [things to do in Delhi when it rains](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-when-it-rains/). Almost all are closed on Mondays, so plan around that.

A solid museum circuit: Start at the **National Museum** (Janpath, 10 AM), walk to the **NGMA** near India Gate (after lunch), then finish at **Gandhi Smriti** (late afternoon). All three are within 3 km of each other in the Lutyens' Delhi area.

For outdoor heritage, the [heritage walks](/delhi/heritage-walks/) cover monuments and architecture across the city — a good complement to a museum-heavy itinerary.
