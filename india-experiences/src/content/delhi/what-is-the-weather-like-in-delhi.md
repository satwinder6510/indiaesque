  - question: "What is the hottest month in Delhi?"
    answer: "May and June are the hottest months, with average highs of 43-45°C and heatwave days hitting 47-48°C. The heat is dry — humidity stays low until the monsoon — but that doesn't make it comfortable. Night temperatures barely drop below 30°C. Outdoor sightseeing is genuinely dangerous during afternoon hours. Hot winds called 'loo' blow in from the Rajasthan desert. Most tourists and many locals avoid Delhi entirely during these months."
  - question: "Does it snow in Delhi?"
    answer: "No, it does not snow in Delhi. While winter temperatures can drop to 2-4°C on the coldest January nights, Delhi doesn't get cold enough for snow. The city sits on the Indo-Gangetic plain at an elevation of about 216 metres — too low and too far south for snowfall. What Delhi does get is dense fog from December to early February, which can reduce visibility to under 20 metres and cause major flight and train delays. For snow, you need to head to the Himalayan hill stations — Shimla and Manali are 8-12 hours north by road."

**Delhi has extreme seasons — scorching summers that hit 45°C+, bone-cold winters that drop to 2°C, and a monsoon that dumps most of the year's rain between July and September.** The city doesn't do mild. Whatever month you visit, you'll need to dress and plan specifically for it.

The best weather windows for tourists are **October-November** and **February-March**, though each month within those ranges has trade-offs involving temperature, pollution, and fog. Here's the full month-by-month breakdown so you know exactly what to expect and what to pack.

## Summer: April to June

This is Delhi at its harshest. Temperatures climb past 40°C by mid-April and stay there until the monsoon arrives in late June or early July.

**May and June** are the worst — average highs of 43-45°C, with heatwave days hitting 47-48°C. The heat is dry (humidity stays low until the monsoon), but that doesn't make it comfortable. Stepping outside between noon and 4 PM feels like walking into an oven. Hot winds called "loo" blow in from the Rajasthan desert, making even shade feel oppressive.

Most historical monuments — Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb — have no shade or air conditioning. Walking around these sites in May requires serious heat management: early morning visits (before 8 AM), carrying 2+ litres of water, and returning to an air-conditioned space by noon. Heatstroke is a real risk, not an exaggeration.

**The silver lining:** Tourist crowds are almost zero. Hotels drop prices by 30-50%. If you absolutely must visit in summer, plan all outdoor activity before 9 AM and after 5 PM.

### What to Pack for Summer
Lightweight, loose cotton clothing. A wide-brimmed hat. High-SPF sunscreen. Electrolyte sachets. A refillable water bottle. Sunglasses. Light-coloured fabrics — dark colours absorb more heat. See our full [packing guide](/delhi/what-should-i-pack-for-delhi/) for details.

## Monsoon: July to September

The monsoon usually hits Delhi in the first week of July and tapers off by mid-September. Temperatures drop to 30-35°C — a relief from summer — but humidity shoots up to 80-90%.

Rain comes in bursts. You might have a clear morning, then 3 hours of heavy downpour, then sunshine again. Delhi's drainage struggles with monsoon volume, and major roads flood regularly. Waterlogging around Minto Bridge, ITO, and parts of South Delhi can stall traffic for hours. Metro is the most reliable transport during heavy rain.

**The upside:** Delhi looks genuinely beautiful during monsoon. The Mughal gardens around Humayun's Tomb and Lodhi Gardens turn lush green. The air quality is the best it gets all year — AQI drops to 30-60, which is clean by Delhi standards. The ruins and tombs look dramatic against grey skies.

**The downside:** Mosquitoes increase sharply. Dengue risk rises. Streets get muddy. Some outdoor attractions may close temporarily during flooding. Shoes get ruined — bring waterproof sandals or shoes you don't care about.

### What to Pack for Monsoon
A compact rain jacket or umbrella (you'll need it daily). Waterproof sandals or quick-dry shoes. Mosquito repellent — DEET-based is most effective. Light, quick-dry clothing. A waterproof bag or dry bag for your phone and camera.

## Autumn: October to November

### October

October is one of Delhi's sweet spots. The monsoon has ended, temperatures settle to 25-33°C, humidity drops, and the skies clear. It's warm enough for a T-shirt during the day and cool enough for comfortable walking all afternoon.

**Dussehra** — the festival celebrating Rama's victory over Ravana — falls in October, with massive Ramlila performances and effigy-burning events across the city. It's one of the most photogenic times to visit.

Air quality is generally good in early October but starts deteriorating toward month's end as crop burning begins in Punjab and Haryana. Check our [pollution guide](/delhi/is-delhi-polluted/) for details on monitoring AQI.

### November

Temperatures: 10-28°C. Mornings and evenings are cool, daytime is pleasantly warm. **This is when pollution spikes** — AQI can exceed 400-500 after Diwali (late October or early November), making November the worst month for air quality. If you visit in November, pack an N95 mask and plan indoor alternatives for bad air days.

Despite the pollution, the weather itself is comfortable for sightseeing, and Diwali celebrations are spectacular if you time your visit right.

## Winter: December to January

The coldest months. Minimums drop to 2-5°C in late December and January, with daytime highs around 15-20°C. Delhi gets dense **fog** during this period — morning visibility can drop to 20 metres, causing flight delays (sometimes by hours) and train cancellations. The fog usually lifts by 10-11 AM.

You'll need proper warm layers: a jacket, sweater, and scarf for mornings and evenings. Hotels in Delhi don't always have great heating — budget hotels rarely have any. Pack warm sleepwear.

**Christmas and New Year** bring pleasant but cold weather. Republic Day on 26 January has the famous military parade, Delhi's biggest annual event.

Air quality remains poor through January. Combined with fog, December and January can feel grim on bad days. On clear days, though, winter sunshine in Delhi is lovely — cool, crisp air and warm light on sandstone monuments.

### What to Pack for Winter
A proper winter jacket (not just a hoodie). Layering pieces — thermal inner, sweater, outer jacket. A scarf and warm socks. An N95 mask for pollution days. Comfortable walking shoes. Sunglasses — winter sun is low and bright.

## Spring: February to March

**February** is arguably the best single month to visit Delhi. Temperatures climb to 8-22°C, pollution starts clearing, and dense fog becomes less frequent. Late February brings spring-like weather — flowers bloom in Lodhi Gardens, and the Mughal Garden (now Amrit Udyan) at Rashtrapati Bhavan opens for its annual flower display.

**March** warms up to 12-30°C. The weather is comfortable until mid-month, then starts getting noticeably warmer by late March. **Holi** falls in March — India's festival of colours — and the energy building through this period is infectious. By late March, you can feel summer approaching, but mornings and evenings remain pleasant.

This is the window where temperature, air quality, and daylight hours are all in your favour. See our guides on the [best time to visit Delhi](/delhi/what-is-the-best-time-to-visit-delhi/) and the [best month to visit](/delhi/what-is-the-best-month-to-visit-delhi/) for more on timing your trip.
