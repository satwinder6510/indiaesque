**Lodhi Colony Art District is where you want to go — it's India's first open-air public art district, with over 50 large-scale murals painted on apartment blocks and government buildings, all completely free to see.** The St+Art India Foundation has been running this project since 2015, bringing artists from over 25 countries to paint here.

The neighbourhood sits in South Delhi between **Lodhi Colony metro** (Violet Line) and **Jor Bagh metro** (Yellow Line), and you can walk the whole circuit in 60-90 minutes. It's one of the [best free things to do in Delhi](/delhi/best-free-things-to-do-in-delhi/) and a strong reason to visit South Delhi even if your hotel is in the centre.

## Lodhi Colony Art District

### What You'll See

The murals range from two-storey portraits to full building-side abstracts. Some of the standout pieces:

**Hendrick Beikirch's "Rickshaw Wallah"** — A massive black-and-white portrait of an old rickshaw puller that covers an entire apartment block on Khanna Market Road. It's the most photographed piece in the district and visible from the main road.

**Amitabh Kumar's geometric abstracts** — Bright, angular patterns on the walls of Block 14 that play with perspective. Stand at different angles and the shapes shift.

**Hanif Kureshi's typographic murals** — Bold text-based works near Mehar Chand Market that are designed to be read from passing cars.

**Yoh Nagao's surrealist creatures** — A Japanese artist's fantastical characters cover the side of a residential block off the main lane. Kids in the neighbourhood use them as landmarks.

New murals go up each year, usually during the **St+Art Delhi Festival** in January-February, so the collection keeps growing. Some older murals have been painted over to make room for new ones — the district is alive, not a static museum.

### How To Walk The Circuit

Start at **Lodhi Colony metro station** (Violet Line, Exit 1). Walk north along the main road and take your first right into the residential blocks. The murals aren't marked on Google Maps individually, but you'll spot them immediately — they're building-sized and impossible to miss.

The main concentration is around these areas:
- **Block 14 and Block 15** — the highest density of murals
- **Mehar Chand Market** — a small local market with murals on surrounding walls, plus a few cafes for a break
- **Khanna Market Road** — where the Beikirch portrait is located
- **The walls along Lodhi Road** heading towards Jor Bagh

Finish at **Jor Bagh metro** (Yellow Line) and you're right next to Lodhi Gardens if you want to keep walking. The whole loop is about 2.5 kilometres.

### When To Visit

**Overcast days** are actually ideal — no harsh shadows on the murals, and colours pop without direct sunlight bleaching them out. If it's sunny, morning or late afternoon works best.

Avoid midday in summer (April-June) — the colony has limited shade and walking in 42°C heat isn't fun. Winter mornings (November-February) are perfect.

## Other Street Art Spots in Delhi

### Shahpur Jat

This urban village near Hauz Khas has smaller murals, stencil art, and paste-ups on the walls of its narrow lanes. The art here is grittier and more spontaneous than Lodhi Colony's curated pieces. Shahpur Jat is also full of independent fashion designers and boutiques, so you can combine art-spotting with shopping.

### Hauz Khas Village

The old village area (distinct from the commercial strip of bars and restaurants) has some street art on crumbling walls near the lake and the Hauz Khas deer park boundary. Less concentrated than Lodhi Colony, but worth noticing if you're already there for dinner or drinks.

### Connaught Place & Surrounds

CP's outer circle and the underpass near Rajiv Chowk metro have had rotating mural projects, though these change frequently. The DMRC (Delhi Metro) has also commissioned platform art at stations like **Hauz Khas** and **INA** on the Yellow Line.

### Yamuna Ghat

During the St+Art Delhi Festival, organisers have occasionally painted murals along the Yamuna river ghats and under flyovers. These are harder to find and not maintained, but if you're into urban exploration, ask at Mehar Chand Market for the latest locations.

## Practical Details

**Cost:** Free everywhere. The murals are on public buildings.

**Time needed:** 60-90 minutes for Lodhi Colony, 30 minutes for Shahpur Jat.

**Getting there:** Lodhi Colony metro (Violet Line) or Jor Bagh metro (Yellow Line). Auto from Connaught Place costs ₹100-150.

**Guided tours:** St+Art India Foundation occasionally runs guided walks during their festival season (January-February). Check **st-artindia.org** for schedules. Otherwise, self-guided is fine — you don't need anyone to tell you where to look.

**Accessibility:** The streets are flat residential roads. Wheelchair accessible for the most part, though some pavement sections are uneven.
