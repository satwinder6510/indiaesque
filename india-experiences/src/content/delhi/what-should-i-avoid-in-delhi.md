  - question: "What are the most common tourist scams in Delhi?"
    answer: "The most common scams target tourists near Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and Connaught Place. Watch out for the 'tourist office' scam where touts direct you to fake travel agencies, rickshaw drivers quoting astronomical fares, ear cleaners and shoe polishers who demand payment after performing unsolicited services, and gem or carpet shop scams where someone befriends you just to take you to a store for commission. Always book through your hotel or verified apps."
  - question: "Is it safe to eat street food in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, but be selective. Eat at stalls with high turnover where food is cooked fresh in front of you. Avoid pre-cut fruit, raw salads, and anything that's been sitting out. Stick to places that are packed with locals — a long queue is the best food safety indicator. Busy stalls in Chandni Chowk, Karol Bagh, and CR Park are generally safe. Carry hand sanitiser and start with cooked items for your first few days."
  - question: "Should I avoid auto-rickshaws in Delhi?"
    answer: "Not entirely, but be cautious. Most auto-rickshaw drivers refuse to use the meter, especially with tourists. Use Uber Auto or Ola Auto through the app to get a fixed fare. If you do hail one on the street, agree on the price before getting in. Avoid autos near tourist spots like Red Fort and India Gate — they charge 3-5x the normal rate. The Delhi Metro is often faster and always cheaper."

**Avoid street taxis, tap water, aggressive touts near monuments, and walking alone in quiet areas after dark.** Delhi isn't dangerous if you know what to sidestep. Most problems tourists run into are preventable with basic awareness and a few smart habits.

## Transport Mistakes

### Street Taxis and Unmetered Autos

This is the number one avoidable hassle. Street taxis and auto-rickshaws near tourist sites quote absurd prices — ₹500 for a ₹100 ride is standard practice around Red Fort and India Gate. Drivers may also take you to shops for commission instead of your actual destination.

**The fix:** Use **Uber** or **Ola** for everything. Both apps show the fare upfront. Uber Auto and Ola Auto work just like regular autos but with tracked routes and fixed pricing. You'll need an Indian SIM for OTP verification — worth getting at the airport. Read more in our [guide to avoiding scams in Delhi](/delhi/how-to-avoid-scams-in-delhi/).

### Prepaid Rickshaws at Railway Stations

The prepaid auto counters at New Delhi Railway Station and Old Delhi Station sound official, but fares are inflated and drivers often claim the prepaid slip doesn't cover "extra distance." Skip them. Walk to the nearest metro station or book an Uber from inside the station.

## Food and Water

### Tap Water

**Never drink tap water in Delhi.** Not in hotels, not in restaurants, not anywhere. Delhi's water supply is treated but picks up contamination in the pipe network. Even locals use RO (reverse osmosis) filtered water or bottled water.

**The fix:** Drink sealed bottled water (check the seal — refilled bottles are a thing), or water from restaurants with RO systems, which is most sit-down places. Avoid ice at street stalls. Our full guide on [whether you can drink tap water in Delhi](/delhi/can-you-drink-tap-water-in-delhi/) has more detail.

### Raw Food on the Street

Street food in Delhi is extraordinary, but raw items are risky. Skip pre-cut fruit from carts (it's been sitting in the heat), raw salads, and chutneys made with unfiltered water. Cooked food from busy stalls is generally fine.

**The fix:** Eat at stalls with fast turnover. If locals are queuing, the food is moving quickly and being made fresh. Stick to cooked items — parathas, samosas, kebabs, jalebis — for the first couple of days while your stomach adjusts.

## Scams and Touts

### The "Tourist Office" Scam

This one catches people around Connaught Place and New Delhi Railway Station. Someone approaches you — sometimes wearing what looks like an official lanyard — and tells you the place you're going to is closed, flooded, or on strike. They helpfully direct you to a "government tourist office" nearby, which is actually a private travel agency that books you overpriced tours and hotels for commission.

**The fix:** The only official India Tourism office in CP is at **88 Janpath**. Ignore anyone on the street directing you elsewhere. If you need help, ask at your hotel.

### Touts at Red Fort and Jama Masjid

The area between Red Fort and Jama Masjid is tout central. You'll get offers for guided tours, cheap souvenirs, photography services, and "free" henna. These are high-pressure sales with inflated prices.

**The fix:** Say "no, thank you" firmly and keep walking. Don't engage, don't make eye contact if you want to avoid the pitch entirely. Book guides through your hotel or a verified platform.

### Unsolicited Services

Ear cleaners, shoe shiners, and "bracelet gifters" near tourist sites perform a service you didn't ask for, then demand payment. The bracelet trick involves someone tying a thread on your wrist while talking to you, then asking for ₹500.

**The fix:** Keep your hands in your pockets near tourist sites. If someone starts doing something to you unprompted, walk away immediately. You don't owe payment for unsolicited services.

## Areas and Situations

### Walking Alone at Night

Delhi is not a city for late-night wandering, especially off main roads. Even areas that feel fine during the day — parts of Karol Bagh, Lajpat Nagar's back streets, areas near railway stations — empty out and feel different after 10 PM.

**The fix:** Stick to well-lit, busy areas after dark. South Delhi, CP's inner circle, and Khan Market are your safest bets. Use Uber or Ola for night transport. Read our [Delhi safety guide](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/) for neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood breakdowns.

### Paharganj

The backpacker area opposite New Delhi Railway Station has cheap accommodation but also aggressive touts, poor sanitation, and frequent scam attempts. Side lanes get uncomfortable after dark.

**The fix:** If you're set on budget accommodation, Karol Bagh or Majnu Ka Tila (the Tibetan colony in North Delhi) are better options with similar prices and fewer hassles.

## Other Things to Skip

**Changing money on the street.** Use ATMs (Citi, HDFC, and ICICI accept international cards reliably) or your hotel's exchange desk. Street money changers near Paharganj and CP offer great rates because they short-change you.

**Wearing flashy jewellery or carrying expensive cameras loosely.** Petty theft isn't rampant, but why make yourself a target? Keep your phone in a front pocket and bags zipped.

**Agreeing to "special prices" without checking.** Whether it's a tour, a ride, or a souvenir, if someone approaches you with a deal, the price is inflated. Check Uber for ride rates, ask your hotel about tour prices, and compare before buying.

The most common scams target tourists near Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and Connaught Place. Watch out for the 'tourist office' scam where touts direct you to fake travel agencies, rickshaw drivers quoting astronomical fares, ear cleaners and shoe polishers who demand payment after performing unsolicited services, and gem or carpet shop scams where someone befriends you just to take you to a store for commission.
