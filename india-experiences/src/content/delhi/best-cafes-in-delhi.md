**Delhi's best cafes include Indian Coffee House in Connaught Place for history, Blue Tokai for specialty coffee, Kunzum Travel Cafe in Hauz Khas for its pay-what-you-want model, and Triveni Terrace Cafe for art gallery vibes.** The city's cafe culture has shifted dramatically in the last decade — you can now find properly pulled espresso and single-origin pour-overs alongside the old-school filter coffee institutions.

## Historic Cafes

### Indian Coffee House — Connaught Place

The most storied cafe in Delhi. Operating since 1957 on the inner circle of [Connaught Place](/delhi/things-to-do-in-connaught-place/), this is where journalists, politicians, and writers gathered for decades. The interior is dark wood panelling and ceiling fans. Waiters in white uniforms and fan-shaped headgear serve South Indian filter coffee in steel tumblers.

The coffee isn't specialty grade — it's strong, sweet, and comforting. Order the **filter coffee** (₹30-50 / $0.35-0.60) and a **masala dosa** (₹80-120 / $1-1.50). The real draw is the atmosphere. People still come here to read the paper and argue. It hasn't been updated, and that's the point.

**Metro:** Rajiv Chowk (Yellow/Blue Line), exit towards the inner circle.

### Wenger's — Connaught Place

Not a cafe in the modern sense, but Wenger's bakery has been in CP since 1926 and has a small seating area where you can eat pastries and drink coffee. Their **chicken patties** and **chocolate eclairs** are Delhi institutions. Prices are old-school too — most items ₹50-150 ($0.60-1.80).

**Location:** A-block, inner circle, Connaught Place.

### Triveni Terrace Cafe — Mandi House

Tucked inside the Triveni Kala Sangam art gallery complex near Mandi House, this open-air terrace cafe serves simple food — rajma chawal, poha, sandwiches — and decent coffee, all surrounded by art galleries. It's one of the quietest spots in central Delhi.

**Cost:** ₹100-250 ($1.20-3) per person. **Metro:** Mandi House (Blue/Violet Line), 5-minute walk. The cafe is free to enter; the galleries are also free and worth browsing.

## Specialty Coffee

### Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters — Multiple Locations

Delhi's best specialty coffee. Blue Tokai sources beans from estates in Chikmagalur, Coorg, and the Nilgiris, roasts them in Delhi, and serves proper pour-overs, espresso, and cold brew. Their baristas know what they're doing.

**Best branches:** The **Champa Gali** location in Saket is the most atmospheric — a narrow lane of cafes and boutiques that feels nothing like Delhi. The **Khan Market** branch is convenient for tourists. The **Defence Colony** outlet has good seating.

**Cost:** Flat white ₹200-280 ($2.40-3.40); pour-over ₹250-350 ($3-4); cold brew ₹200-250. **Beans to take home:** ₹350-600 ($4-7) per 250g bag.

### Perch Wine and Coffee Bar — Khan Market

Half wine bar, half specialty coffee shop. The espresso is excellent, the space is airy with high ceilings, and there's a balcony overlooking Khan Market. The afternoon shift is quiet and good for working.

**Cost:** Coffee ₹200-350 ($2.40-4); wine from ₹400. **Metro:** Khan Market (Violet Line).

### Third Wave Coffee — Multiple Locations

A Bangalore-born chain that's expanded aggressively across Delhi. Consistent specialty coffee at slightly lower prices than Blue Tokai. Branches in Hauz Khas, Saket, CP, and many other areas.

**Cost:** ₹150-250 ($1.80-3) for most drinks.

### Sleepy Owl — Multiple Locations

Started as a cold brew brand, now has cafes across Delhi. Their bottled cold brew is available in grocery stores too. The cafe spaces are clean and minimal.

**Cost:** Cold brew ₹180-250 ($2.20-3); hot coffee ₹150-250.

## Character Cafes

### Kunzum Travel Cafe — Hauz Khas Village

A unique spot in [Hauz Khas Village](/delhi/things-to-do-in-hauz-khas/) that operates on a pay-what-you-want basis. There's no fixed menu or pricing — you grab a coffee or chai, sit with their library of travel books, play a board game, and leave whatever you think is fair in the donation box. The walls are covered in travel photography and maps.

Running since 2010, Kunzum is a genuine community space, not a gimmick. It's also a working photography gallery. Good for a slow afternoon.

**How to find it:** Walk into Hauz Khas Village from the main entrance, and it's on the left side about 100 metres in. **Metro:** Green Park (Yellow Line) or Hauz Khas (Yellow Line), then auto.

### Ama Cafe — Majnu ka Tilla

In Delhi's Tibetan refugee colony near Vidhan Sabha metro station, Ama Cafe serves Tibetan food, strong coffee, and has a relaxed backpacker atmosphere. The **thukpa** (noodle soup) and **momos** with coffee is a solid combination. The entire Majnu ka Tilla colony is worth exploring for an hour.

**Cost:** ₹100-250 ($1.20-3) per person. **Metro:** Vidhan Sabha (Yellow Line).

### Full Circle Bookshop Cafe — Khan Market

A bookshop with a pleasant upstairs cafe. Browse, grab a stack of books, order a coffee and cake, and settle in. The cafe is small and fills up on weekends, but weekday afternoons are quiet.

**Cost:** Coffee ₹150-250 ($1.80-3); cake ₹200-350.
