faq:
  - question: "Do I need a visa for India?"
    answer: "Most nationalities need an e-visa for India. Apply online at indianvisaonline.gov.in at least 4 days before travel. 30-day tourist e-visas cost $25, 1-year visas cost $40. Over 160 countries are eligible. Nepali and Bhutanese citizens don't need a visa."
  - question: "Can you drink tap water in Delhi?"
    answer: "No — never drink tap water in Delhi. The pipe network is old and prone to contamination. Stick to sealed bottled water (check the seal), RO-filtered water in restaurants, or water you've purified yourself. Most restaurants use RO systems; street stalls do not."
  - question: "How much should I tip in Delhi?"
    answer: "Tip 10% at restaurants if there's no service charge already on the bill. Round up to the nearest ₹10 for auto rickshaws. Hotel porters expect ₹50-100 per bag. Tour guides: ₹200-500 for half-day, ₹500-1,000 for full-day. Street food stalls: no tipping expected."
  - question: "What currency does Delhi use?"
    answer: "Delhi uses the Indian Rupee (₹/INR). $1 USD equals roughly ₹83-85. ATMs are everywhere — HDFC, ICICI, SBI are most reliable for foreign cards. Cards work at most restaurants and shops; you'll need cash for autos, street food, and markets."
  - question: "How much money do I need per day in Delhi?"
    answer: "Budget ₹2,000-3,000 ($24-36) per day for hostels and street food. Mid-range ₹5,000-10,000 ($60-120) for hotels and restaurants. Luxury ₹15,000+ ($180+). The biggest costs are accommodation and monument entry fees (₹550 each for foreigners)."
  - question: "Is Delhi expensive?"
    answer: "Delhi is cheap by Western standards. Street food meals cost ₹50-150. A thali at a local restaurant runs ₹150-300. Metro rides are ₹10-60. The main expense is monument entry fees for foreigners (₹550 per site) and accommodation if you want comfort."
  - question: "What should I pack for Delhi?"
    answer: "Pack light, loose-fitting clothes in natural fabrics. Cover shoulders and knees for temple visits. Bring a scarf (pollution/sun/modesty), comfortable walking shoes, sunscreen, insect repellent, and any prescription medications. Bring a power adapter (Type C/D plugs, 230V)."
  - question: "What should I avoid in Delhi?"
    answer: "Don't drink tap water or eat raw salads at basic restaurants. Don't agree to unsolicited tour guides or drivers at tourist sites. Don't exchange money at hotels (bad rates). Don't carry valuables in crowded areas. Don't take prepaid taxis from inside the airport — use Uber or official cabs."

This is everything you need to know before arriving in Delhi — visas, money, health, costs, packing, and the practical details that make your trip smoother. Bookmark this page and read it on the flight over.

## Visas and Entry Requirements

**Most nationalities need an e-visa to enter India.** Over 160 countries are eligible to apply online at indianvisaonline.gov.in — the only official website. Avoid third-party sites that charge double.

### E-Visa Options

| Visa Type | Fee | Duration | Max Stay Per Visit |
|-----------|-----|----------|-------------------|
| 30-day e-tourist | $25 | 30 days from arrival | 30 days |
| 1-year e-tourist | $40 | 1 year from issue | 90 days (180 for US) |
| 5-year e-tourist | $80 | 5 years from issue | 90 days (180 for US) |

If you're visiting Delhi for a week or two, the 30-day visa is cheapest. If there's any chance you'll return within a year, the 1-year visa at $40 is better value.

### How to Apply

1. Go to **indianvisaonline.gov.in** (the only official site)
2. Prepare: passport valid 6+ months, digital passport photo (white background), passport scan
3. Fill in the form — takes 15-20 minutes
4. Pay by card — $25-80 depending on visa type
5. Wait 72 hours on average (apply 4-7 days before travel)
6. Print the e-visa approval and carry it with your passport

**At the airport:** Use the e-visa immigration counters at Terminal 3 — they're separate from regular queues and usually faster.

**Who doesn't need a visa:** Nepali and Bhutanese citizens can enter without a visa. OCI cardholders have lifelong entry rights.

## Water and Food Safety

### Tap Water: Never Drink It

**Never drink tap water in Delhi.** The water is treated at the source, but the pipe network is decades old with cracks and contamination points. Even locals don't drink from the tap — almost every Delhi household has an RO water purifier.

**What's safe:**
- Sealed bottled water — check the seal is intact. Common brands: Bisleri, Kinley, Aquafina. ₹20 for 1 litre at shops (₹40-80 at tourist sites)
- RO-filtered water in restaurants — look for branded RO dispensers (Kent, Aquaguard)
- Water at hotels — most provide complimentary bottled water or have RO systems

**What's not safe:**
- Tap water anywhere — including hotel bathroom sinks
- Ice at street stalls — restaurant ice is usually fine
- Refilled bottles — always check the seal snaps cleanly

### Avoiding Delhi Belly

Skip raw salads at basic restaurants (washed in tap water). At upscale restaurants, raw food is fine. Watch garnishes at street stalls. Be extra careful the first 2-3 days while your gut adjusts. Carry oral rehydration salts (ORS) — available at any pharmacy.

## Money and Currency

### The Basics

Delhi uses the **Indian Rupee (₹/INR)**. As of 2026, $1 USD ≈ ₹83-85. No shops accept foreign currency — exchange at the airport or withdraw from ATMs.

### Getting Rupees

**ATMs** are everywhere — Metro stations, malls, bank branches. Most reliable for foreign cards: HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Axis Bank. Withdrawal limits: ₹10,000-25,000 per transaction. Fee: ₹200-250 per withdrawal.

**Airport exchange** counters at Terminal 3 are open 24/7. Rates are 2-4% worse than city rates but fine for your first day's cash.

**Money changers** in Connaught Place have competitive rates. Look for RBI authorisation. Avoid exchanging at hotels — worst rates.

### Cards vs Cash

**Cards work at:** Mid-range to upscale restaurants, hotels, malls, branded shops, monument ticket counters. Visa and Mastercard accepted widely; Amex less so.

**You need cash for:** Auto rickshaws, street food, traditional markets (Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar), small shops, temple donations.

**Carry ₹2,000-3,000 in small denominations daily.** Ask for smaller notes at ATMs or break large notes at supermarkets. ₹500 notes are hard to break at small vendors.

## Tipping Guide

India doesn't have a rigid tipping culture, but it's appreciated and makes a real difference to workers.

### Quick Reference

| Situation | Tip Amount |
|-----------|-----------|
| Restaurant (no service charge) | 10% of bill |
| Restaurant (with service charge) | Nothing additional |
| Street food stall | Nothing |
| Auto rickshaw | Round up to nearest ₹10 |
| Hotel porter | ₹50-100 per bag |
| Housekeeping | ₹50-100 per day |
| Tour guide (group) | ₹100-300 per person |
| Tour guide (private, full day) | ₹500-1,000 per person |
| Driver (full day) | ₹300-500 |

**Restaurants:** Check if 10% service charge is already on the bill. If not, tip 10%. At casual places, rounding up by ₹50-100 is fine.

## Daily Costs and Budgeting

### Budget Tier: ₹2,000-3,000/day ($24-36)

Hostel dorm (₹500-800), street food meals (₹200-400), metro transport (₹100-150), one monument (₹550). Tight but absolutely doable.

### Mid-Range Tier: ₹5,000-10,000/day ($60-120)

Private hotel room (₹2,500-5,000), mix of street food and restaurants (₹700-1,500), Uber + metro (₹300-600), 2-3 monuments (₹1,100-1,650). The sweet spot for most visitors.

### Luxury Tier: ₹15,000-30,000+/day ($180-360+)

5-star hotel, fine dining, private car with driver, guides at every site. World-class experience at a fraction of London or New York prices.

### Where Money Goes

- **Accommodation:** 40-60% of budget — biggest controllable expense
- **Monument fees:** ₹550 each for foreigners at Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar
- **Food:** Absurdly cheap — three street meals for under ₹400
- **Transport:** Tiny with metro — 3-day tourist card is ₹200 unlimited

## What to Pack

### Clothing

- Light, loose-fitting clothes in natural fabrics (cotton, linen)
- Cover shoulders and knees for temple and mosque visits
- A scarf or dupatta — useful for pollution, sun, and modesty
- Comfortable walking shoes — you'll cover a lot of ground
- A light jacket for December-February evenings (it gets cold)

### Essentials

- **Power adapter:** India uses Type C and D plugs, 230V. Bring a universal adapter.
- **Sunscreen and hat:** Even in winter, the sun is strong
- **Insect repellent:** Especially October-March (post-monsoon mosquitoes)
- **Prescription medications:** Bring enough for your trip plus extra
- **Hand sanitizer and wet wipes:** Street food demands them
- **Portable battery pack:** Your phone will die navigating Delhi

### What Not to Pack

- Expensive jewellery or flashy watches
- Heavy winter coats (even in January, a light jacket is enough)
- Too many clothes — laundry is cheap and fast in Delhi

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Using unofficial visa websites.** Only indianvisaonline.gov.in is legitimate. Others charge 2-3x the fee.

**Not printing your e-visa.** Immigration still asks for a paper copy. Don't rely on your phone.

**Drinking tap water.** Even one sip can cause problems. Stick to sealed bottles.

**Exchanging money at hotels.** Rates are 3-5% worse than ATMs or money changers.

**Taking prepaid taxis inside the airport.** Uber and Ola are cheaper and more reliable. The official prepaid booth outside Terminal 3 is fine, but touts inside often overcharge.

**Accepting unsolicited guides at monuments.** If you didn't arrange a guide, you don't owe them anything. See our [safety guide](/delhi/is-delhi-safe-for-tourists/) for more.

**Overpacking.** Delhi has excellent laundry services. A 3-day wardrobe is enough for any length trip.
