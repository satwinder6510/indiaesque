  - question: "How long does a walking tour of Old Delhi take?"
    answer: "A self-guided walking tour covering the main route — Chandni Chowk Metro to Red Fort, through the bazaars, Paranthe Wali Gali, the Spice Market, and ending at Jama Masjid — takes 3-4 hours at a comfortable pace with food stops. If you add the Red Fort interior (1-1.5 hours) and climb Jama Masjid's minaret, budget 5-6 hours total."
  - question: "Is Old Delhi safe to walk around?"
    answer: "Yes. Old Delhi is safe for tourists during daytime hours. The lanes are crowded and chaotic, but violent crime against visitors is extremely rare. Keep your phone in a zipped pocket (petty pickpocketing happens in dense crowds), watch for cycle rickshaws and motorbikes in narrow lanes, and stay on the main routes during your first visit. Women travelling solo may attract attention but are not at higher risk of crime in this area during the day."
  - question: "What is the best time to walk around Old Delhi?"
    answer: "Start between 7:00 and 8:00 AM. The lanes are quieter, the light is softer for photography, and the food stalls are freshly set up. By 10:00 AM the crowds thicken significantly. Avoid afternoons in summer (April-June) when temperatures exceed 40°C. The October-March cool season is ideal — pleasant walking weather all day."

**You can walk the essential highlights of Old Delhi on your own in 3-4 hours, starting at Chandni Chowk Metro station and ending at Jama Masjid, covering roughly 3 kilometres through the bazaars, food lanes, and Mughal-era streets of Shahjahanabad.** No guide is needed — the route below is linear and easy to follow with a phone map.

## Before You Start

**When to go:** Start between 7:00 and 8:00 AM. The lanes are navigable, the light is good, and the food stalls are freshly set up. By 10:00 AM the main roads become packed with shoppers, delivery carts, and cycle rickshaws. If you start at 7:00 AM, you'll finish by 10:30-11:00 AM and avoid the worst of the crowds.

**What to wear:** Comfortable walking shoes with closed toes (the lanes are uneven and sometimes wet). Loose, breathable clothing. If you plan to enter Jama Masjid, wear clothing that covers shoulders and knees — women should carry a scarf for head covering.

**What to bring:** A water bottle (refill at any shop for ₹20), a small daypack, cash in small denominations (₹10, ₹20, ₹50 — many street food stalls don't accept UPI), and your phone with offline maps downloaded (Google Maps works, but signal can drop in the densest lanes).

**What to leave behind:** Expensive jewellery, large bags, tripods (impractical in the narrow lanes). For tips on avoiding common tourist issues, read our guide on [how to avoid scams in Delhi](/delhi/how-to-avoid-scams-in-delhi/).

## The Route

### Stop 1: Chandni Chowk Metro Station (Start Point)

Take the Yellow Line to Chandni Chowk Metro station. Exit from Gate 3, which puts you directly onto Chandni Chowk road facing east toward the Red Fort. The wide avenue stretching in front of you was designed by Shah Jahan in 1650 as the main commercial street of his new capital, Shahjahanabad. It once had a canal running down the centre that reflected moonlight — "Chandni Chowk" means "Moonlit Square."

The road was pedestrianised and redesigned in 2021. The central section now has a clean walkway, heritage lighting, and clear signage. Turn left (east) and walk toward the Red Fort.

**Distance to next stop:** 1.2 km, 15-minute walk.

### Stop 2: Red Fort (Lal Qila)

The Red Fort's Lahore Gate appears at the eastern end of Chandni Chowk. The sandstone walls rise 33 metres and run 2.5 km in perimeter. Even if you don't go inside (entry is ₹600/$7.50 for foreigners, and the interior takes 1-1.5 hours), the exterior view from the road and the Lahore Gate archway are impressive.

**If you enter:** The Diwan-i-Am and Diwan-i-Khas are the highlights. The fort museums are modest. See our guide on [whether Red Fort is worth visiting](/delhi/is-red-fort-worth-visiting/) for a detailed breakdown.

**If you skip the interior:** Photograph the Lahore Gate, then turn around and walk back west along Chandni Chowk. The walking tour continues along this road.

**Distance to next stop:** 500 metres back west along Chandni Chowk.

### Stop 3: Chandni Chowk Bazaars

Walking west from the Red Fort along Chandni Chowk, you'll pass through a succession of specialised markets, each a few hundred metres apart.

**Dariba Kalan** (Silver Street) branches off to the left (south) about 400 metres from the Red Fort. This narrow lane has sold silver jewellery since the Mughal era. The shops are tiny, stacked floor to ceiling with silver bangles, chains, and earrings. Prices start at ₹500 ($6) for simple silver pieces. Even if you're not buying, the lane is atmospheric — look up at the crumbling havelis (mansions) above the shops.

**Kinari Bazaar** runs parallel, one lane south. This is the wedding supplies market — sequined fabrics, tinsel, ribbons, artificial flowers, and decorative items in every colour. If you've ever seen an Indian wedding on film and wondered where they get all that material, this is where.

Walk through either bazaar lane for 10-15 minutes, then return to the main Chandni Chowk road and continue west.

**Distance to next stop:** 200 metres west along Chandni Chowk, then south.

### Stop 4: Paranthe Wali Gali (Paratha Lane)

Turn south off Chandni Chowk into Paranthe Wali Gali — "the lane of parathas." This narrow alley has been serving stuffed, deep-fried parathas (flatbreads) since the 1870s. Three original restaurants remain: **Pt. Gaya Prasad Shiv Charan**, **Pt. Kanhaiyalal Durga Prasad**, and **Pt. Baburam**.

The parathas here are not the light, flaky parathas you get elsewhere. They're deep-fried in ghee or oil and come stuffed with everything from potato and paneer to rabri (sweetened cream), papad, and mixed vegetable. They're heavy, greasy, and delicious in the way only Old Delhi street food can be.

**What to order:** Start with an aloo (potato) paratha and a mint-coriander chutney. One paratha costs ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) depending on the filling. Two parathas with sides is a full breakfast.

For the full story on this lane, read our [Paranthe Wali Gali guide](/delhi/what-is-paranthe-wali-gali/).

**Distance to next stop:** 400 metres north and then west to Khari Baoli.

### Stop 5: Khari Baoli — Asia's Largest Spice Market

Head back to Chandni Chowk road and walk west, then turn north at Fatehpuri Masjid. Khari Baoli road opens up with the overwhelming scent of dried chillies, turmeric, cumin, and coriander hitting you from the wholesale shops on both sides. This is Asia's largest spice market, operating since the 17th century.

The sacks of spices are stacked in doorways and sometimes spill onto the pavement. Shops sell retail quantities too — small bags of saffron (₹200-500/$2.50-6 for a gram), garam masala blends, dried whole chillies, and black cardamom. If you want to buy spices as souvenirs, this is the place — prices are 30-50% cheaper than tourist shops elsewhere in Delhi.

**Warning:** The chilli dust in the air is real. If you have sensitive lungs or allergies, cover your nose and mouth. Some visitors find it makes their eyes water.

**Spend:** 15-20 minutes walking through. Don't feel pressured to buy — browsing is expected.

**Distance to next stop:** 800 metres southeast to Jama Masjid.

### Stop 6: Matia Mahal and the Food Lanes

Walk south from Khari Baoli toward Jama Masjid. You'll enter the Matia Mahal neighbourhood — the lane that runs from Jama Masjid's Gate 1 into the residential heart of Old Delhi. This is where the most famous food establishments sit.

**Karim's** is down a narrow lane to the right — look for the signage. The mutton burra kebab and seekh kebab are the strongest dishes. A plate costs ₹200-400 ($2.40-5).

**Al Jawahar** is directly opposite Jama Masjid's main entrance. Their biryani and nihari are excellent, and the upper floor has a mosque view. Read more about both in our [Old Delhi eating guide](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/).

If you've already eaten at Paranthe Wali Gali and you're full, just walk through and observe. If you have room, get a plate of kebabs at Karim's or a kulfi (Indian ice cream) from one of the street vendors — ₹30-50 ($0.40-0.60) per stick.

**Distance to next stop:** 100 metres south to Jama Masjid.

### Stop 7: Jama Masjid (End Point)

The walk ends at Jama Masjid, India's largest mosque. The view as you approach from the Matia Mahal lanes is dramatic — the massive gateway and twin minarets rising above the rooftops of the old city.

**Climb the southern minaret** (₹300 for foreigners) for a panoramic view of Old Delhi — the rooftops, the Red Fort walls in the distance, and the sprawl of the city beyond. This is the best aerial photograph you'll get of Old Delhi.

The mosque courtyard is vast — 25,000 people can pray here simultaneously. Walk the perimeter, see the prayer hall, and sit for a few minutes if the atmosphere draws you in. The mosque is free to enter; a camera fee of ₹200-300 applies if you bring a DSLR or mirrorless camera. Phone photography is fine.

**Hours:** Open to visitors outside prayer times. Avoid 12:30-2:00 PM on Fridays (main prayer session). **Dress code:** Shoulders and knees covered. Women should cover their hair. Robes are available for rent at the entrance if needed (₹100).

## After the Walk

From Jama Masjid, you have several options:

- **Metro:** Walk to Jama Masjid Metro station (Violet Line), 5 minutes east.
- **Rickshaw:** Take a cycle rickshaw back to Chandni Chowk Metro (₹30-50) for the Yellow Line.
- **Continue exploring:** The [heritage walk circuit](/delhi/heritage-walks/) continues from here to the Red Fort interior if you skipped it earlier.

## Practical Tips

**Pace yourself.** The sensory intensity of Old Delhi is real — noise, crowds, smells, heat. Take breaks. Sit at a chai stall (₹10-20 per cup) and watch the street for 10 minutes when you need to reset.

**Haggling is expected** in the bazaars. Start at 50-60% of the asking price and negotiate up. Shopkeepers expect it and won't be offended. For more on this, see our [bargaining guide](/delhi/is-bargaining-expected-in-delhi-markets/).

**Cycle rickshaws** are useful for covering short distances between stops if your legs tire. A ride within Old Delhi costs ₹20-50 ($0.25-0.60). Agree on the price before getting in.

**Restrooms** are scarce. Use the facilities at the metro station before you start, or the ones inside Red Fort or Jama Masjid. Some restaurants (Karim's, Al Jawahar) will let you use theirs if you're eating there.

**Photography:** Old Delhi is extremely photogenic, but ask before photographing people directly — especially women and workers. Most people are friendly about it; some are not. Respect the response.

## Is Old Delhi Safe to Walk Around?

Yes. Old Delhi is safe for tourists during daytime hours. The lanes are crowded and chaotic, but violent crime against visitors is extremely rare. Keep your phone in a zipped pocket (petty pickpocketing happens in dense crowds), watch for cycle rickshaws and motorbikes in narrow lanes, and stay on the main routes during your first visit. Women travelling solo may attract attention but are not at higher risk of crime in this area during the day.
