  - question: "What is the best fine dining restaurant in Delhi?"
    answer: "Indian Accent at The Lodhi hotel is consistently ranked as Delhi's best fine dining restaurant and regularly appears on Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list. Chef Manish Mehrotra serves modern Indian food — think blue cheese naan, pulled pork phulka tacos, and daulat ki chaat reimagined as dessert. A tasting menu runs ₹6,000-8,000 ($72-96) per person without drinks. Book at least a week ahead."
  - question: "Where can I eat the best Mughlai food in Delhi?"
    answer: "Karim's near Jama Masjid has been serving Mughlai food since 1913 and is the most famous option — their mutton burra kebab is outstanding. For a more upscale Mughlai experience, Dum Pukht at ITC Maurya does slow-cooked dishes in sealed pots. Al Jawahar opposite Jama Masjid is less crowded than Karim's and arguably has better biryani. Budget ₹300-600 per person at Karim's, ₹3,000-5,000 at Dum Pukht."
  - question: "Are Delhi restaurants expensive?"
    answer: "Delhi has restaurants at every price point. A full meal at a street food stall costs ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40). Mid-range restaurants in Connaught Place or Khan Market run ₹500-1,200 ($6-14) per person. Fine dining at places like Indian Accent or Bukhara costs ₹4,000-10,000 ($48-120) per person with drinks. You can eat extraordinarily well in Delhi for very little money."

**Delhi's best restaurants span from the legendary Bukhara at ITC Maurya for dal makhani and tandoori meats, to Indian Accent for modern Indian fine dining, to Karim's for Mughlai kebabs that have been on the grill since 1913.** This is a city where you can spend ₹100 or ₹10,000 on a meal and both can be exceptional.

## Fine Dining

### Indian Accent — The Lodhi Hotel, Lodhi Road

Delhi's most celebrated restaurant. Chef Manish Mehrotra takes classic Indian flavours and reworks them into dishes that are genuinely inventive without being gimmicky. The **daulat ki chaat** (a traditional Old Delhi winter sweet) appears as a dessert, and the **blue cheese naan** has become iconic.

**Cost:** Tasting menu ₹6,000-8,000 ($72-96) per person; a la carte around ₹4,000-6,000 ($48-72) without drinks. **Reserve:** At least a week ahead, more during tourist season. **Metro:** Nearest is JLN Stadium (Violet Line), then a short cab ride.

### Bukhara — ITC Maurya, Diplomatic Enclave

Bukhara has been serving frontier cuisine since 1977, and the menu hasn't changed much because it doesn't need to. No cutlery — you eat with your hands, wearing a bib. The **dal makhani** (black lentils slow-cooked for 18 hours) is the most famous dal in India. The **sikandari raan** (whole leg of lamb) needs 24-hour advance notice.

**Cost:** ₹5,000-8,000 ($60-96) per person with drinks. **Reserve:** Essential, especially for dinner. Former US President Bill Clinton ate here; they still have his favourite table.

### Dum Pukht — ITC Maurya, Diplomatic Enclave

In the same hotel as Bukhara but a completely different experience. Dum pukht means "slow cooking" — dishes are sealed in pots with dough and cooked for hours. The **biryani dum pukht** and **raan-e-Dum Pukht** are the standouts.

**Cost:** ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) per person. More refined and quieter than Bukhara.

## Heritage and Mughlai

### Karim's — Jama Masjid, Old Delhi

Operating since 1913 in a lane near Jama Masjid's Gate 1. The [Old Delhi location](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/) is the original — ignore the branches elsewhere. **Mutton burra kebab**, **seekh kebab**, and **chicken jahangiri** are the strongest dishes. The setting is basic: shared tables, fluorescent lights, ceiling fans. The food doesn't need atmosphere.

**Cost:** ₹300-600 ($3.60-7) per person. No reservations; just show up.

### Al Jawahar — Opposite Jama Masjid

Often overlooked in favour of Karim's, but locals will tell you Al Jawahar's **biryani** and **nihari** are superior. The upper floor has a direct view of Jama Masjid, which Karim's can't match.

**Cost:** ₹250-500 ($3-6) per person.

### Moti Mahal — Daryaganj

The restaurant that invented [butter chicken](/delhi/what-food-is-delhi-famous-for/) in 1947. Kundan Lal Gujral created the dish here, and Moti Mahal still operates at its original location on Netaji Subhash Marg. The butter chicken is good, not the city's best anymore, but eating it at the place where it was invented is the point.

**Cost:** ₹400-700 ($5-8.50) per person.

## Modern and International

### SodaBottleOpenerWala — Khan Market and CP

Parsi comfort food in a setting designed to look like an old Irani cafe in Bombay. **Berry pulao** (rice with dried berries), **dhansak** (lentil and meat stew), and **bun maska with chai** are the highlights. Fun, affordable, and reliably good.

**Cost:** ₹600-1,000 ($7-12) per person. The Khan Market branch is smaller and cosier.

### Farzi Cafe — Connaught Place

Molecular gastronomy meets Indian food. The dal chawal (lentils and rice) arrives as an arancini ball, and the chaat comes deconstructed. It's playful without being pretentious, and the cocktails are strong.

**Cost:** ₹1,000-1,800 ($12-22) per person with drinks.

### Yum Yum Cha — Khan Market and Hauz Khas

Pan-Asian with a focus on dim sum, ramen, and sushi. The **truffle edamame dumplings** and **chicken bao** are popular. Reliable for when you want a break from Indian food.

**Cost:** ₹800-1,400 ($10-17) per person.

## Regional Indian

### Naivedyam — Hauz Khas

South Indian food done properly. **Paper dosa**, **filter coffee**, and full **South Indian thali** platters. The Hauz Khas branch is the original.

**Cost:** ₹300-600 ($3.60-7) per person.

### Andhra Bhawan Canteen — Feroze Shah Road

The canteen at the Andhra Pradesh state guesthouse serves a thali lunch that's famous across Delhi. Unlimited rice, dal, sambar, rasam, and multiple vegetable dishes. It's institutional dining — metal trays, long tables, fast service — and the food is fiery hot and fantastic.

**Cost:** ₹250-350 ($3-4) for unlimited thali. **Open:** Lunch only, 12-3 PM. Queue forms by 11:45. **Metro:** Barakhamba Road (Blue Line).

## Budget Picks

- **Sita Ram Diwan Chand**, Paharganj — chole bhature, ₹80 ($1)
- **Rajma Chawal**, Rajouri Garden — kidney bean curry with rice, ₹100-150 ($1.20-1.80)
- **Indian Coffee House**, Connaught Place — coffee and snacks in a historic setting, ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40)
