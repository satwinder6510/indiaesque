  - question: "How long does Delhi belly usually last?"
    answer: "Most cases of Delhi belly last 2-4 days. The worst symptoms — watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea — typically peak in the first 24-48 hours and then gradually improve. Mild cases resolve in 1-2 days with rest and fluids. If symptoms persist beyond 5 days, include blood in stool, or come with high fever, see a doctor. Pharmacies across Delhi stock antibiotics like norfloxacin and ORS sachets over the counter."
  - question: "Is street food in Delhi safe to eat?"
    answer: "Yes, if you choose wisely. Eat at stalls with high turnover where food is cooked fresh in front of you — a crowd of locals is the best quality indicator. Avoid pre-cut fruit, raw salads, and anything that's been sitting in the open. Stick to fully cooked items like parathas, samosas, kebabs, and jalebis. Start with one street food meal per day for the first 2-3 days to let your stomach adjust. Busy stalls in Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh are generally safe."
  - question: "What medicine should I bring for Delhi belly?"
    answer: "Pack loperamide (Imodium) for stopping diarrhea when you need to travel or can't access a toilet. Bring ORS (oral rehydration salts) sachets or electrolyte tablets. A course of azithromycin or ciprofloxacin from your travel doctor is useful for severe bacterial infections — get a prescription before you leave home. In Delhi, pharmacies sell these over the counter, but having them ready saves time. Pepto-Bismol tablets also help with mild stomach upset."

**Delhi belly is traveller's diarrhea — your stomach reacting to bacteria in food or water that locals are adapted to but your gut isn't.** It's common, rarely serious, and largely preventable with sensible precautions. Most cases hit within the first 2-5 days of arrival and clear up on their own within 48 hours.

## What Causes It

Your digestive system has adapted to the specific bacteria in your home country's food and water supply. India has a different bacterial profile — not necessarily worse, just different. When your gut encounters unfamiliar strains of E. coli, Campylobacter, or other bacteria, it reacts with diarrhea, cramps, and sometimes nausea.

The usual triggers:

- **Contaminated water** — tap water, ice from street stalls, water used to wash salads or fruit
- **Food prepared with unclean water** — chutneys, raw garnishes, lettuce
- **Food left sitting out** — pre-cooked items on display in the heat
- **Unwashed hands** — yours or the cook's
- **Dairy from unreliable sources** — especially street-side lassi and kulfi where hygiene varies

It's not about the spice. Chilli doesn't cause Delhi belly. Bacteria do.

## How to Prevent It

### Water Rules

This is the single biggest factor. Drink only [sealed bottled water or RO-filtered water](/delhi/can-you-drink-tap-water-in-delhi/). Check the seal on every bottle. Avoid ice at street stalls. In restaurants, ice is generally fine if the place has an RO system — which most sit-down restaurants do.

Use bottled water to brush your teeth for the first few days if you want to be thorough. It's not paranoia; it's just easier than dealing with a stomach bug.

### Street Food Strategy

Delhi's street food is extraordinary, and you should absolutely eat it. Just be smart about where and what.

**Eat at stalls with fast turnover.** If 20 people are queuing for chole bhature at a Chandni Chowk stall, that food is being made fresh and selling quickly. Fresh means fewer bacteria have time to develop. The empty stall next door with pre-made food sitting under a cloth is a higher risk.

**Stick to cooked food initially.** Parathas, samosas, pakoras, kebabs, jalebis, and anything coming off a hot tawa or out of a fryer is safer than raw items. Heat kills bacteria.

**Avoid these for the first few days:**
- Pre-cut fruit from street carts (washed in tap water, sitting in heat)
- Raw salads and chutneys from basic stalls
- Golgappas / pani puri (the pani is made with water of unknown provenance at street level)
- Street-side lassi and kulfi from carts without refrigeration

**After 3-4 days**, once your stomach has started adjusting, you can gradually expand. Most seasoned India travellers eat golgappas, street lassi, and everything else after the initial adjustment period. Check our guide on [whether street food is safe in Delhi](/delhi/is-street-food-safe-in-delhi/) for stall-by-stall recommendations.

### Hygiene Basics

**Carry hand sanitiser** and use it before every meal. This one habit prevents a surprising number of stomach issues. You're touching metro rails, door handles, money, and market goods all day — none of that should end up in your mouth.

**Wash your hands with soap** when a proper sink is available. Before eating, always.

## What to Do if You Get It

### Mild Cases (Most People)

- **Hydrate aggressively.** The danger from Delhi belly is dehydration, not the infection itself. Drink ORS (oral rehydration salts) mixed with bottled water. **Electral** is the most common ORS brand in India, available at every pharmacy for ₹20-30 per sachet.
- **Rest.** Cancel your sightseeing for the day. Pushing through makes it worse.
- **Eat bland food.** Plain rice, khichdi (rice and lentil porridge), bananas, toast. Skip spicy food, dairy, and caffeine until you're better.
- **Take loperamide (Imodium)** if you need to travel or can't access a toilet. It doesn't cure the infection — it just slows things down. Don't rely on it for more than a day.

### If It Gets Worse

See a doctor if:
- Diarrhea lasts more than 3-4 days
- You have a fever above 38.5°C / 101°F
- There's blood in your stool
- You can't keep liquids down

Delhi has excellent private hospitals. **Max Hospital** (Saket and East Block), **Apollo** (Sarita Vihar), and **Sir Ganga Ram Hospital** (Rajinder Nagar) all have walk-in clinics. A consultation costs ₹500-1,500 ($6-18) at private hospitals. Pharmacies stock antibiotics like norfloxacin and azithromycin over the counter, but see a doctor first for the right diagnosis.

## What to Pack (Medical Kit)

Pack these before you leave home:

- **Loperamide (Imodium)** — 10-12 tablets
- **ORS sachets or electrolyte tablets** (Nuun, Hydralyte)
- **Azithromycin or ciprofloxacin** — get a prescription from your travel doctor for a 3-day course. This is your backup for severe bacterial diarrhea.
- **Pepto-Bismol tablets** — helps with mild stomach upset and nausea
- **Probiotics** — some travellers swear by starting these a week before the trip to build gut resilience

## Perspective

About 30-50% of travellers to India experience some form of stomach upset. Most of those cases are mild and last a day or two. It's common enough to have a nickname, but it's not inevitable. Travellers who follow the water and food precautions above have a much lower incidence. And once your gut adjusts — usually within the first week — you can eat nearly everything Delhi puts in front of you.

## How Long Does Delhi Belly Usually Last?

Most cases of Delhi belly last 2-4 days. The worst symptoms — watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea — typically peak in the first 24-48 hours and then gradually improve. Mild cases resolve in 1-2 days with rest and fluids. If symptoms persist beyond 5 days, include blood in stool, or come with high fever, see a doctor.

Yes, if you choose wisely. Eat at stalls with high turnover where food is cooked fresh in front of you — a crowd of locals is the best quality indicator.
