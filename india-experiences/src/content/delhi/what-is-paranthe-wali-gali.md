  - question: "How old is Paranthe Wali Gali?"
    answer: "Paranthe Wali Gali has been serving stuffed parathas since the 1870s, making it over 150 years old. The oldest continuously operating shop is Pandit Gaya Prasad Shiv Charan, which claims to have started in 1872. The alley once had over a dozen paratha shops; today about five remain, all within a narrow lane off the main Chandni Chowk road near Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib."
  - question: "What fillings can you get at Paranthe Wali Gali?"
    answer: "The shops offer over 30 fillings. Classic options include aloo (potato), gobhi (cauliflower), paneer, methi (fenugreek), and mixed dal. Unusual fillings include rabri (sweetened condensed milk), papad (crispy lentil wafer), banana, cashew, and even cauliflower with pomegranate. Each paratha is deep-fried in ghee or oil, served with potato curry, pickle, and a dollop of butter."
  - question: "When should I visit Paranthe Wali Gali?"
    answer: "Go between 8 AM and 11 AM for the best experience. The oil is freshest in the morning, the parathas come out crispier, and the lane isn't yet packed with the afternoon crowds. Most shops open by 8 AM and serve until 10 PM, but the quality genuinely drops as the day goes on. Avoid Tuesdays — some shops in Chandni Chowk close that day."

**Paranthe Wali Gali is a narrow alley in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi, where five shops have been frying stuffed parathas since the 1870s — making it one of the oldest continuous food streets in India.** The name literally translates to "alley of parathas," and the shops here serve over 30 different fillings, from the classic potato to the eccentric banana and rabri.

## Where Exactly Is It?

The alley branches off the main Chandni Chowk Road, near **Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib** (the large white Sikh temple visible from the main road). Coming from **Chandni Chowk metro station** (Yellow Line), walk west along the main road for about 5 minutes. The lane entrance is on your left, marked by a small archway. It's narrow — barely wide enough for two people to pass — and about 50 metres long.

If you're struggling to find it, ask any shopkeeper for "Paranthe Wali Gali" and they'll point you in the right direction. It's also a standard stop on most [Old Delhi food tours](/delhi/food-tours/).

## The Shops

There were once over a dozen paratha shops in this alley. Today, about five remain:

**Pandit Gaya Prasad Shiv Charan** — the oldest, claiming to have started in 1872. This is where most first-timers go. The parathas are fried in a large kadhai of ghee, served on a steel plate with aloo ki sabzi (potato curry), mixed pickle, and butter.

**Pandit Baburam's** — considered by many locals to have the best texture. Their parathas tend to be slightly thinner and crispier than the competition.

**Pt. Kanhaiya Lal Durga Prasad** — known for their unusual fillings, including the rabri paratha (sweet) and the papad paratha.

The remaining shops are smaller operations, all serving similar quality. Honestly, the differences between shops are minor — you won't go wrong at any of them.

## What to Order

**Classic fillings (start here):**
- **Aloo** (potato) — the baseline Delhi paratha, spiced and satisfying
- **Gobhi** (cauliflower) — lighter than aloo, with a slight crunch
- **Paneer** — rich, creamy, the most filling option
- **Methi** (fenugreek) — slightly bitter greens, pairs perfectly with pickle

**Adventurous fillings:**
- **Rabri** — sweetened condensed milk inside a fried paratha. Sounds strange, tastes like a dessert
- **Papad** — crushed papad (lentil wafer) mixed with spices
- **Mixed dal** — lentil paste with green chilli
- **Banana** — sliced banana with sugar, more like a sweet snack than a meal
- **Cashew** — crushed nuts, rich and heavy

Each paratha plate costs **₹60-120 ($0.70-1.50)** depending on the filling. Paneer and cashew cost more; aloo and gobhi are cheapest. A plate typically comes with one paratha, potato curry, pickle, and a slick of butter on top.

Two parathas is enough for most people. Three will leave you unable to walk.

## When to Go

**Best time: 8 AM to 11 AM.** The oil is freshest in the morning, which makes a noticeable difference in the paratha's crispness. By afternoon, the oil has been used for hours and the parathas can taste heavier.

Morning also means shorter queues. By noon, especially on weekends, the lane fills up and you'll wait 15-20 minutes for a plate.

**Avoid Tuesdays** — several shops in the Chandni Chowk area close. **Avoid Friday afternoons** near prayer time.

The shops stay open until around 10 PM, but going after dark means you're eating parathas fried in oil that's been working all day. Go early.

## How to Eat Them

Tear off a piece of paratha, scoop up some potato curry and pickle, and eat with your hands. The paratha should be crispy on the outside, soft and stuffed on the inside. If it's soggy or oily to the point of dripping, the batch isn't great — ask for one from the next round.

Don't bother with a fork. This is hand food.

## What Else to Eat Nearby

Paranthe Wali Gali is in the heart of [Old Delhi's food district](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/). Within a 10-minute walk you can hit:

- **Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala** — Delhi's best yoghurt dumplings, on the main Chandni Chowk road
- **Old Famous Jalebi Wala** — hot jalebis at the Dariba Kalan crossing
- **Karim's** — kebabs near Jama Masjid's Gate 1

A good eating route: parathas for breakfast, walk through the spice market at Khari Baoli, then kebabs for lunch. Read our full guide on [things to do in Old Delhi](/delhi/things-to-do-in-old-delhi-chandni-chowk/) for the non-food side of the neighbourhood.

## Is It Overhyped?

Partially. Paranthe Wali Gali is a genuine historic food street, but the parathas aren't the best in Delhi — plenty of homes and smaller restaurants across the city make superior versions. What makes this place special is the history and the spectacle of watching parathas being fried in massive kadhais in a lane that's been doing exactly this for 150 years. Go for the experience as much as the food.
