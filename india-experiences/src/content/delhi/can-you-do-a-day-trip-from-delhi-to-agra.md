**Yes, you can absolutely do a day trip from Delhi to Agra — the Gatimaan Express gets you there in 1 hour 40 minutes, giving you roughly 6 hours to see the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort before catching the evening train back.** Thousands of visitors do this trip every week, and it works well if you plan the timing right.

## The Two Best Options

### Option 1: Gatimaan Express (Fastest)

The Gatimaan Express is India's fastest conventional train on this route and the most practical option for a day trip.

- **Departs**: Hazrat Nizamuddin station, Delhi — 8:10 AM
- **Arrives**: Agra Cantt station — 9:50 AM
- **Return departs**: Agra Cantt — 5:50 PM
- **Return arrives**: Hazrat Nizamuddin — 7:30 PM
- **Cost**: ₹750 ($9) in AC Chair Car, ₹1,500 ($18) in Executive Class

This gives you roughly 8 hours in Agra from arrival to departure. Subtract travel time to and from the Taj Mahal (20-30 minutes from Agra Cantt), and you have about 6 solid hours for sightseeing.

**Book tickets**: Through the IRCTC website or app at least 2-3 days in advance. Weekends and October-March (peak tourist season) sell out fast. For a full breakdown of train options and alternatives, see our guide on [how to get from Delhi to Agra](/delhi/how-to-get-from-delhi-to-agra/).

### Option 2: Hire a Car and Driver

A private car with driver via the Yamuna Expressway takes 3-3.5 hours in good traffic, 4 hours if traffic is heavy leaving Delhi.

- **Cost**: ₹3,000-4,000 ($36-48) for a return trip with waiting time
- **Leave**: 5:30-6:00 AM from your Delhi hotel
- **Arrive**: 8:30-9:30 AM in Agra
- **Return**: Leave Agra by 4:00-5:00 PM to be back in Delhi by 8:00-9:00 PM

The advantage of driving is flexibility — your driver waits while you sightsee, and you can stop at Fatehpur Sikri on the way back if time allows. Book through your hotel or use a service like Savaari or GetMeCab.

## What to See in 6 Hours

Here's a realistic itinerary for a day trip:

### Taj Mahal (2-3 hours)

Head straight to the Taj Mahal from the station. Enter through the **West Gate** (less crowded than the East Gate). The monument opens at sunrise, so if you arrive by 10 AM, the morning light is still good.

**Entry**: ₹1,100 ($13) for foreign visitors, which includes a bottle of water, shoe covers, and access to the mausoleum interior. Tickets are available at the gate or online through the ASI website.

**Tip**: The Taj is closed on Fridays. Plan your day trip for any other day.

Spend 2-3 hours here. Walk through the gardens, see the main mausoleum from multiple angles (the view from the raised marble platform on the Yamuna river side is the least photographed and most striking), and visit the mosque on the west side.

### Agra Fort (1.5-2 hours)

A 15-minute auto ride from the Taj (₹100-150). This massive red sandstone fort was the Mughal seat of power. Highlights include the **Diwan-i-Khas** (Hall of Private Audience) with its white marble interior, the **Sheesh Mahal** (Mirror Palace), and the **Musamman Burj** — the octagonal tower where Emperor Shah Jahan was imprisoned and spent his last years gazing at the Taj Mahal across the river.

**Entry**: ₹550 ($6.50) for foreign visitors.

### Lunch (45 minutes)

Eat near the Taj at **Oberoi Amarvilas** terrace (₹2,000-3,000/$24-36 per person, but you eat with a Taj view) or at **Pinch of Spice** on Fatehabad Road (good North Indian food, ₹500-800/$6-9.60 per person). For street food, try the petha (sweet pumpkin candy) shops near Agra Fort — petha is Agra's signature sweet and costs ₹100-300 ($1.20-3.60) per box.

### If You Have Extra Time

- **Itimad-ud-Daulah** (Baby Taj) — a smaller, exquisitely detailed marble tomb. 30 minutes from Agra Fort. Entry ₹210 ($2.50).
- **Mehtab Bagh** — gardens across the Yamuna with a direct view of the Taj's rear. Best at sunset, but a day tripper usually needs to skip this.

## Day Trip vs. Overnight

A day trip makes sense if:
- You only want the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort
- You're short on time in Delhi
- You prefer sleeping in your Delhi hotel

An overnight stay makes sense if:
- You want sunrise at the Taj (the best light)
- You want to add Fatehpur Sikri (1 hour west of Agra)
- You don't want to feel rushed
- You're continuing to Jaipur afterward (Golden Triangle route)

For comparison, the [Delhi to Agra to Jaipur](/delhi/best-weekend-trips-from-delhi/) route is the classic Golden Triangle and works well as a 3-4 day extension.

## Practical Tips

**Don't take a bus.** The bus from Delhi to Agra is slow, uncomfortable, and stops frequently. Train or private car only.

**Avoid touts at Agra station.** Auto-rickshaw drivers and "guides" will approach you at Agra Cantt station. Agree on a price before getting in (₹200-300 to the Taj Mahal) or pre-book a car. Don't accept offers of "free" rides to marble shops.

**Carry cash.** Many Agra vendors and auto-rickshaws don't accept UPI or cards. Bring ₹3,000-5,000 in small denominations.

**Wear comfortable shoes.** You'll walk a lot on marble and stone surfaces. Shoes must be removed or covered inside the Taj Mahal mausoleum.
