**Nizamuddin Dargah is where you go — every Thursday evening, qawwali singers perform live Sufi devotional music for free in the courtyard of this 14th-century shrine, and it's one of the most powerful things you can experience in Delhi.** Sessions start around 6:30-7:00pm and run for 1.5-2 hours.

The dargah (shrine) is the resting place of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, one of the most revered Sufi saints in South Asia. Qawwali has been performed here continuously for over 700 years. This isn't a tourist show — it's a living devotional tradition. The singers are professionals from families who have been performing at the shrine for generations, and the audience is a mix of devotees, locals, and visitors.

## Thursday Evening Qawwali at Nizamuddin

### What To Expect

The courtyard fills up fast after the evening Maghrib prayer (around 6:00-6:30pm, depending on the season). Singers set up on one side of the open courtyard, cross-legged on the floor with harmonium and tabla. The audience sits in concentric circles around them — there are no chairs, no stage, no sound system. Just voices, instruments, and the acoustics of a stone courtyard.

The music starts slow. Classic qawwali compositions build in intensity over 15-20 minute sets. The lead singer calls, the chorus responds, the harmonium pushes the tempo, and the whole courtyard starts moving. People raise their hands, sway, close their eyes. Some devotees reach an ecstatic state. It's raw and real.

Between sets, rose petals are offered, and donations are placed in front of the musicians. There's no fixed fee — give what you feel is right. ₹100-200 ($1.20-2.40) is normal.

### How To Get There

The dargah is in **Nizamuddin Basti**, a dense neighbourhood in central-south Delhi. Take the metro to **JLN Stadium** (Violet Line) and walk 10 minutes southwest through the basti's narrow lanes. You can also take an auto-rickshaw to the main gate — drivers know it well.

The lanes leading to the dargah are narrow and packed with flower sellers, incense stalls, and food vendors. Follow the crowd and the sound. For a full guide to the area, see our [Nizamuddin guide](/delhi/things-to-do-in-nizamuddin/).

### What To Wear & Bring

**Cover your head.** Men and women both need head coverings inside the dargah. If you don't have a scarf, stalls outside sell them for ₹20-50 — or you'll often be handed a cloth at the entrance.

**Remove your shoes** at the gate. There's an informal shoe-minding service — leave them with the attendant and tip ₹10-20 when you collect them.

**Dress modestly.** Long trousers or skirts. Shoulders covered. This is an active religious site, not a performance venue.

**Leave the camera down.** Photography is technically not allowed inside the main shrine area, and shooting during qawwali is poor etiquette. Watch with your eyes. If you want to take photos elsewhere in the basti, ask first and be discreet.

### Timing

Arrive by **6:00pm** to get a good spot. The courtyard is small and fills quickly. If you arrive at 7:00pm, you'll be standing at the back, which is still fine — the sound carries well.

Thursday is the main night, but qawwali sometimes happens on other evenings during religious occasions, Urs festivals (the death anniversary celebration of the saint), and Ramadan nights. Check locally or ask your hotel.

## Other Places to Hear Sufi Music

### Annual Sufi Festivals

**Jashn-e-Rekhta** and the **Sufi Festival at Purana Qila** (usually November) feature ticketed qawwali concerts with major performers like the Nizami Brothers and Wadali Brothers. These are stage performances with sound systems — polished and less raw than Nizamuddin, but the musical quality is high. Tickets range from ₹500-2,000.

### Restaurants & Bars With Live Sufi Music

A handful of Delhi restaurants feature live Sufi or qawwali-influenced music on certain evenings:

**Chor Bizarre** — Hotel Broadway, Asaf Ali Road, near Old Delhi. Occasional live music nights with Sufi and folk musicians. Call ahead to check their schedule.

**Zaffran** — Connaught Place, E Block. Mughlai restaurant with live music some evenings, including Sufi-influenced performances.

These are dinner-and-music experiences, not devotional settings. The music is background, not the focus. Go for the food and consider the music a bonus.

### India Habitat Centre

The IHC on Lodhi Road regularly hosts concerts and cultural events, including Sufi music performances. Check their monthly calendar at **indiahabitat.org**. Events are usually ticketed at ₹200-500 and held in their amphitheatre or gallery spaces.

## Sufi Music Beyond Delhi

If the Nizamuddin experience moves you, consider visiting **Ajmer Sharif** in Rajasthan — the dargah of Moinuddin Chishti, the spiritual master of Nizamuddin Auliya. The qawwali tradition there is even older, and the annual Urs festival (usually in the Islamic month of Rajab) draws millions. It's a 5-6 hour train ride from Delhi.

## When To Go

Thursday evenings year-round. But the [winter months](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-at-night/) are best — sitting in an open courtyard is far more comfortable in December (12-15°C at night) than in June (35°C+ at sunset). During Ramadan, the basti comes alive after Iftar and evening sessions can run longer.
