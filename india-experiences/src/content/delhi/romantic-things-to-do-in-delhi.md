**Lodhi Gardens at sunset is the most romantic thing you can do in Delhi — it's free, gorgeous, and the golden light through the Mughal ruins makes everything feel cinematic.** Pair it with dinner at Indian Accent and you've got a world-class date night in a city that doesn't get enough credit for romance.

Delhi's romantic side lives in its quieter corners: garden walks among 500-year-old tombs, candlelit meals in converted heritage buildings, rooftop cocktails overlooking the city lights. The key is knowing where to go and when — the right spot at golden hour transforms Delhi from chaotic capital to something genuinely beautiful.

This guide mixes free experiences with premium ones, so whether you're on a budget or celebrating something special, there's a plan here for you.

## Daytime Romance

### Lodhi Gardens at Sunset

A 90-acre park with 15th-century Mughal tombs scattered among old neem and jamun trees. The path that loops through the gardens takes about 45 minutes to walk slowly, and the stretch near **Bara Gumbad** is the most photogenic — especially in late afternoon when the sun drops low.

Enter from **Jor Bagh metro** (Yellow Line) gate. The park is open sunrise to 8pm and it's free. Mornings are popular with joggers; late afternoons belong to couples. In winter (November-February), the light from 4:30-5:30pm is extraordinary.

### Sunder Nursery

Right next to Humayun's Tomb, this restored Mughal heritage garden is quieter and more manicured than Lodhi Gardens. Palm-lined walkways, rose gardens, water channels, and heritage structures spread across 90 acres. It opened fully in 2018 and still doesn't draw the same crowds.

**Entry:** ₹30 ($0.35). Open 7am-7pm (winter), 7am-8pm (summer). Nearest metro: JLN Stadium (Violet Line).

Walk the central avenue together, find a bench near the lotus pond, and let the city disappear for an hour. On weekends, they sometimes host classical music evenings — check at the gate. The rose gardens peak in January and February with over 100 varieties in bloom.

### Old Fort (Purana Qila) Boating

The lake in front of Purana Qila offers pedal boat rides for ₹100-150 per 30 minutes. It's simple, a little old-fashioned, and that's what makes it charming. The fort walls rise behind you, the water is calm, and nobody's in a hurry. Best between October and March when the weather cooperates.

**Nearest metro:** Pragati Maidan (Blue Line), 10-minute walk.

## Champa Gali — Evening Magic

A narrow lane in Saket behind the Select Citywalk mall area, accessed through an industrial back road. The alley is lined with fairy lights, independent cafes, and boutique shops. **Jugmug Thela** serves chai and snacks under string lights. **Blue Tokai Coffee** does excellent pour-overs (₹200-350).

It's tiny — you'll walk the whole lane in 10 minutes — but the atmosphere is intimate and quiet, especially on weekday afternoons. Go before sunset and grab a table outside. The fairy lights come on as the sky darkens and the lane transforms into something unexpectedly lovely.

## Dinner Spots

### Indian Accent

Delhi's most celebrated restaurant, inside The Lodhi hotel on Lodhi Road. Chef Manish Mehrotra's modern Indian tasting menus reinterpret classic dishes with precision and surprise. The dining room is warm, the lighting is low, and the service is attentive without hovering.

**Cost:** ₹6,000-8,000 ($72-96) per person for the tasting menu with wine pairing. A la carte averages ₹4,000-5,000. Book at least 5-7 days ahead for dinner — this is the hardest reservation in Delhi.

### Lavaash by Saby

Armenian-Bengali fusion in Mehrauli. The outdoor terrace is draped in greenery and fairy lights. The food is inventive — smoked lamb ribs, beetroot hummus, and naan with truffle butter. ₹2,500-3,500 per person with drinks. Less formal than Indian Accent but just as memorable for a date night.

### Tres

A small, warmly lit space in Lodhi Colony (near Lodhi Art District). Mediterranean menu, excellent wine list, and the kind of hushed atmosphere where you can actually hold a conversation. ₹2,000-3,000 per person. No reservations — arrive by 7:30pm to guarantee a table.

### Olive Bar & Kitchen

In Mehrauli, near the Qutub Minar. Mediterranean food in a whitewashed courtyard with olive trees. The setting is more romantic than the food, which is decent but not exceptional. ₹3,000-4,000 per person with wine. Sunday brunch is popular but crowded — go for a weeknight dinner instead.

## Rooftop Evenings

### Connaught Place Rooftops

Several CP bars have terraces overlooking the circular market. **Unplugged Courtyard** has live music and rooftop tables. **Lord of the Drinks** has a multi-level terrace on the outer circle. Cocktails run ₹500-800, and the view of CP's Georgian columns lit up at night is genuinely pretty.

Walk from **Rajiv Chowk metro** (Blue/Yellow Line). For more on the CP scene, see our [nightlife guide](/delhi/best-nightlife-in-delhi/).

### Ek Bar — Defence Colony

A speakeasy-style cocktail bar with a rooftop terrace. The drinks are Delhi's most creative — think smoked paan Old Fashioned and saffron gin sour (₹600-900). Small plates are good too. The terrace fits maybe 20 people, so it stays intimate. Go early on weekends.

### Sky Lounge — Aerocity

If you want polished and high-altitude, the rooftop bars at Aerocity's five-star hotels deliver. Views of the airport and South Delhi skyline. Drinks ₹800-1,200. Dress smart.

## Spa Experiences for Two

Several Delhi spas offer couples' treatment rooms where you can book side-by-side massages and wellness rituals.

**The Claridges Spa (Aurangzeb Road):** Couples' Ayurvedic massage packages start at ₹8,000-12,000 ($96-145) for 90 minutes. The spa is inside one of Delhi's heritage hotels, and the treatment rooms are spacious and private.

**Kairali Ayurvedic Centre (Greater Kailash):** Traditional Kerala-style treatments. A couples' Abhyanga (warm oil massage) costs ₹5,000-7,000 ($60-85) for 60 minutes. Less fancy than hotel spas but more authentic.

**Hotel spa day passes:** Several five-star hotels in Chanakyapuri and Aerocity sell day passes that include pool access and one treatment. ₹4,000-8,000 per person. Worth it on a hot afternoon or as a special-occasion treat.

## Experiences Together

**Cooking class for two:** Several operators in South Delhi run couples' cooking classes where you prepare a 4-5 course Indian meal together. ₹3,000-5,000 ($36-60) per couple. It's hands-on and fun — you leave with recipes and a full stomach.

**Evening at Nizamuddin Dargah:** On Thursday evenings, the qawwali at Nizamuddin shrine is one of the most moving experiences in Delhi. It's not conventionally romantic, but sharing something that powerful with someone you care about is its own kind of intimacy. It's free. Arrive by 6pm.

**Heritage walk at dusk:** The area around Humayun's Tomb and Sunder Nursery is beautiful in the last hour of daylight. Walk the gardens, watch the tomb catch the sunset, and head to dinner in nearby Nizamuddin or Defence Colony.

## Budget vs. Splurge

**Free/cheap date:** Lodhi Gardens sunset, walk to Champa Gali, chai at Jugmug Thela. Total: ₹200-500 ($2.50-6).

**Mid-range date:** Sunder Nursery walk (₹30 each), coffee at Blue Tokai (₹400), dinner at Tres (₹5,000-6,000 for two). Total: ₹5,500-6,500 ($66-78).

**Splurge date:** Purana Qila boating (₹150), couples' spa at The Claridges (₹10,000), dinner at Indian Accent (₹14,000-16,000 for two with wine). Total: ₹24,000-26,000 ($290-315).

## Best Season

**November to February.** Delhi's winter is the sweet spot — cool evenings (10-18°C), clear skies, and every outdoor space becomes usable. Rooftop dining is at its best. Lodhi Gardens in January morning mist is practically cinematic. Summer (April-June) pushes everything indoors, though Champa Gali and restaurant experiences work year-round.
