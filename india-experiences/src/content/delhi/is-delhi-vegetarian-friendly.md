  - question: "What percentage of Delhi restaurants are vegetarian?"
    answer: "Roughly 30-40% of restaurants in Delhi are exclusively vegetarian, marked with green 'pure veg' signs. Of the remaining restaurants, nearly all serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food with extensive veg sections on their menus. In areas like Karol Bagh, Rajouri Garden, and parts of South Delhi, vegetarian restaurants outnumber non-veg ones. You will never struggle to find vegetarian food in Delhi."
  - question: "What are the best vegetarian dishes in Delhi?"
    answer: "Chole bhature (chickpea curry with fried bread), paneer tikka, dal makhani (slow-cooked black lentils), aloo gobhi (potato and cauliflower), stuffed parathas, rajma chawal (kidney beans with rice), dahi bhalle (lentil dumplings in yoghurt), golgappe, and a full South Indian dosa with sambar. For sweets, try jalebi, rabri, and gulab jamun. Delhi's vegetarian food is some of the most flavourful you'll find anywhere."
  - question: "Can vegans eat well in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, with some awareness. Much of Delhi's vegetarian food is naturally vegan — dal, chana masala, aloo gobi, rajma, and most chaat items use oil rather than ghee or dairy. However, many dishes include ghee (clarified butter), cream, paneer, or yoghurt. Ask for 'bina ghee' (without ghee) and 'bina cream' (without cream) when ordering. South Indian restaurants are often the easiest for vegans — dosas, idlis, and sambar are dairy-free by default."

**Delhi is one of the most vegetarian-friendly cities in the world — roughly a third of all restaurants are exclusively vegetarian, and the rest have extensive veg menus.** You'll see green "pure veg" signs on storefronts everywhere. Vegetarian food in Delhi isn't an afterthought; it's a major part of the city's food identity.

## Why Delhi Is So Vegetarian

Delhi's huge vegetarian culture comes from its demographics. The city has large Punjabi, Marwari (Rajasthani), Jain, and South Indian communities, all with strong vegetarian traditions. Many Delhi families are strictly vegetarian — not as a dietary choice, but as a generations-old cultural practice.

This means vegetarian food here has had centuries of development. It's not "meat dishes with the meat removed." The vegetarian dishes stand on their own — complex, heavily spiced, and designed to be the main event.

## Best Vegetarian Dishes to Try

### Street Food

Most of Delhi's famous street food is already vegetarian:

- **Chole bhature** — chickpea curry with deep-fried puffed bread. Sita Ram Diwan Chand in Paharganj, ₹80 ($1)
- **Golgappe** — crispy shells with spiced water. Bhimsain's in Bengali Market, ₹40-60 ($0.50-0.70)
- **Dahi bhalle** — lentil dumplings in whipped yoghurt. Natraj in Chandni Chowk, ₹80 ($1)
- **Aloo tikki** — spiced potato patties with chutneys. Kashi Chaat Bhandar in Amar Colony, ₹60-80 ($0.70-1)
- **Stuffed parathas** — at Paranthe Wali Gali in Chandni Chowk, ₹60-100 ($0.70-1.20)
- **Ram ladoo** — moong dal fritters with radish, from carts everywhere, ₹30-40 ($0.35-0.50)
- **Jalebis** — crispy sugar-syrup spirals at Old Famous Jalebi Wala, ₹60-80 ($0.70-1)

A [food tour through Old Delhi](/delhi/food-tours/) can be done entirely vegetarian — most operators offer a dedicated vegetarian route.

### Restaurant Dishes

- **Dal makhani** — black lentils slow-cooked with butter and cream. The version at Bukhara (ITC Maurya) is legendary. Simpler versions at any dhaba for ₹100-200
- **Paneer tikka** — marinated cottage cheese grilled in a tandoor
- **Rajma chawal** — kidney bean curry with rice, Delhi's comfort food
- **Palak paneer** — spinach and cottage cheese curry
- **Chana masala** — tangy chickpea curry, different from chole
- **Baingan bharta** — smoky mashed aubergine

### South Indian Vegetarian

Delhi has a strong South Indian restaurant scene. **Naivedyam** in Hauz Khas, **Saravana Bhavan** (multiple locations), and **Sagar** in Defence Colony all serve excellent dosas, idlis, vadas, and full thali meals. A South Indian thali — unlimited rice, sambar, rasam, and multiple vegetable dishes — costs ₹200-400 ($2.50-5) and is entirely vegetarian.

**Andhra Bhawan Canteen** on Feroze Shah Road does one of Delhi's best thalis at ₹250-350 ($3-4) — fiery, generous, and strictly vegetarian.

## Understanding Delhi's Vegetarian Labels

Look for these signs on restaurant fronts:

- **"Pure Veg"** — no meat, fish, or eggs served anywhere on the premises
- **Green dot** on packaged food — vegetarian (India's mandatory labelling system)
- **Red/brown dot** — contains non-vegetarian ingredients
- **"Jain food available"** — no onion, garlic, or root vegetables in addition to no meat. Useful for strict dietary requirements.

Many restaurants in areas like **Karol Bagh**, **Rajouri Garden**, **Lajpat Nagar**, and **CR Park's** Bengali sweet shops clearly label vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections on their menus. You won't need to guess.

## Vegan in Delhi

Veganism is less understood as a concept in Delhi than vegetarianism, but a lot of Delhi food happens to be vegan:

- **Street chaat** — golgappe, aloo tikki, papdi chaat (ask for no dahi/yoghurt)
- **Chole bhature** — the chole is vegan; the bhature often contain yoghurt in the dough, but many stalls use water-based dough
- **Dal fry and chana masala** — usually cooked in oil, not ghee, at street stalls
- **South Indian** — dosa, idli, sambar, and most chutneys are naturally vegan

The challenge is **dairy**. North Indian restaurant cooking relies heavily on ghee (clarified butter), cream, and paneer. When ordering, say **"bina ghee, bina cream"** (without ghee, without cream) and ask if the dish can be made with oil instead. Most restaurants will accommodate this.

Dedicated vegan restaurants are growing in Delhi. **Greenr Cafe** in Meherchand Market and **Rose Cafe** in Saket are good options with clearly labelled vegan menus.

## Best Areas for Vegetarian Food

- **Chandni Chowk** — most street food is vegetarian by default. See our [best street food guide](/delhi/what-is-the-best-street-food-in-delhi/)
- **Karol Bagh** — predominantly vegetarian neighbourhood with strong Punjabi food
- **Rajouri Garden** — excellent chole bhature and chaat stalls
- **Connaught Place** — mixed, but Saravana Bhavan and Indian Coffee House are reliable vegetarian options
- **Defence Colony** — Naivedyam for South Indian, plus multiple vegetarian restaurants

## Dietary Restrictions Beyond Vegetarian

Delhi is generally good at accommodating dietary needs:

- **Gluten-free** — rice-based dishes, dosas, and most dals are naturally gluten-free. Avoid rotis, naans, and anything fried in shared oil with bread
- **Nut-free** — inform the restaurant. Many gravies use cashew paste
- **Halal** — all meat in Old Delhi and most of Delhi is halal by default
