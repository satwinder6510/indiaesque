  - question: "What street food should I avoid in Delhi?"
    answer: "Avoid pre-cut fruit displayed in the open (it attracts flies and bacteria), anything with crushed ice made from tap water, salads or raw vegetables from street stalls, and food from stalls with no customers. Also skip reheated food that's been sitting in trays — the risk is in food that's been cooked hours ago and left at room temperature, not in the cooking itself."
  - question: "Will I get Delhi belly from street food?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Most travellers who get sick in Delhi got it from contaminated water, not from cooked street food. Freshly fried, grilled, or boiled food from busy stalls is generally safe because the high heat kills bacteria. Your risk goes up with raw items, still water, and food that's been sitting out. Start with small portions on your first day to let your gut adjust."
  - question: "Should I take a food tour or eat on my own?"
    answer: "A food tour is smart for your first time. Guides know which stalls have the best hygiene, which items are freshly made, and which lanes to skip. Group food tours in Old Delhi cost ₹1,500-3,500 per person and cover 8-12 tastings in 3-4 hours. After that first guided experience, you'll have the confidence to explore on your own."

**Delhi street food is mostly safe if you stick to busy stalls with high customer turnover — a crowd means the food is fresh and constantly being replenished.** Millions of Delhiites eat street food daily without issue. The risk isn't in street food itself; it's in choosing the wrong stall or the wrong item.

## Why Busy Stalls Are Safe

The logic is simple: a stall selling 200 plates of chole bhature before noon is making fresh batches constantly. The oil is hot, the food is cooked to order, and nothing sits around long enough to go bad. An empty stall with trays of pre-made food sitting at room temperature is where problems start.

High-heat cooking — deep frying, grilling over charcoal, boiling — kills bacteria effectively. The famous stalls in Chandni Chowk, like **Karim's**, **Natraj Dahi Bhalle Wala**, and **Paranthe Wali Gali**, serve hundreds of people daily. Their food safety record is solid because their business depends on it.

## What to Eat Freely

These items are generally safe from any busy stall:

- **Freshly fried foods**: chole bhature, samosas, jalebis, pakoras, ram ladoo — the frying oil is hot enough to sterilise
- **Grilled kebabs**: seekh kebabs and tikkas cooked on charcoal reach temperatures well above the danger zone
- **Freshly assembled chaat**: dahi bhalle, golgappe, and aloo tikki made to order in front of you
- **Hot parathas**: cooked on a griddle with oil or ghee right before serving
- **Tea and coffee**: boiled water, safe everywhere

For a guided introduction to the safest and best stalls, a [food tour through Old Delhi](/delhi/food-tours/) is a practical first step.

## What to Avoid

A few categories carry higher risk:

**Pre-cut fruit** displayed on carts — it's been sitting out, exposed to flies and touched by hands. If you want fruit, buy whole fruit and peel it yourself, or eat it at a proper restaurant.

**Tap water ice** — ice made from unfiltered tap water is a common source of stomach trouble. Most reputable stalls in tourist areas now use filtered water or commercial ice (you can tell by the cylindrical shape with a hole through the middle). If unsure, skip ice-based drinks. This includes the flavoured golas (snow cones) sold on the street. See our guide on [whether you can drink tap water in Delhi](/delhi/can-you-drink-tap-water-in-delhi/).

**Raw salad and uncooked vegetables** — onion rings and green chutney on the side are usually fine, but avoid leafy salads from street carts.

**Reheated food** — if a stall has trays of food sitting under a cloth with no visible cooking happening, move on.

**Empty stalls** — no customers means either the food isn't good or it's been sitting there too long. Both are reasons to skip it.

## First-Day Strategy

If you've just arrived in Delhi and your stomach hasn't adjusted yet, start cautiously:

1. Eat at **established, named stalls** rather than random carts — places like Sita Ram Diwan Chand, Natraj, and Karim's have reputations to protect
2. Stick to **hot, freshly cooked items** for the first two days
3. Take **small portions** — try three or four bites of each dish rather than finishing full plates
4. Carry a **bottle of filtered water** (brands like Bisleri or Kinley, check the seal is intact)
5. Consider popping a **probiotic** daily for a week before and during your trip

By day three, most travellers find their stomachs have adjusted, and they can eat more freely.

## The Real Culprit: Water, Not Food

Most cases of [Delhi belly](/delhi/what-is-delhi-belly-and-how-to-avoid-it/) come from contaminated water rather than cooked food. This includes tap water used for rinsing glasses in restaurants, ice in drinks, and water used to wash raw vegetables. Stick to sealed bottled water, and you eliminate the biggest risk factor.

## Hygiene Signs to Watch For

A few quick checks before you order:

- **Is the cook using a ladle or tongs?** Direct hand contact with cooked food is a yellow flag
- **Is there a visible cooking flame or hot oil?** Active cooking means fresh food
- **Is the stall crowded?** Locals know which stalls are safe — follow them
- **Are the serving plates clean?** Many stalls use disposable leaf plates or paper, which is actually more hygienic than reused ceramic
- **Does the stall have running water for hand-washing?** Better stalls do

## Medication to Carry

Pack these just in case:

- **ORS packets** (oral rehydration salts) — available at every pharmacy in Delhi for ₹20-30
- **Imodium or loperamide** — for symptom relief
- **Norfloxacin or azithromycin** — consult your doctor before travel and carry a course as a backup
- **Probiotics** — daily use helps build gut resilience

The best stalls in places like [Old Delhi](/delhi/where-to-eat-in-old-delhi/) and the [top street food spots](/delhi/what-is-the-best-street-food-in-delhi/) have been feeding travellers safely for years. Use common sense, and you'll eat extremely well.

## What Street Food Should I Avoid in Delhi?

Avoid pre-cut fruit displayed in the open (it attracts flies and bacteria), anything with crushed ice made from tap water, salads or raw vegetables from street stalls, and food from stalls with no customers. Also skip reheated food that's been sitting in trays — the risk is in food that's been cooked hours ago and left at room temperature, not in the cooking itself.

## Will I Get Delhi Belly From Street Food?

Not necessarily. Most travellers who get sick in Delhi got it from contaminated water, not from cooked street food. Freshly fried, grilled, or boiled food from busy stalls is generally safe because the high heat kills bacteria. Your risk goes up with raw items, still water, and food that's been sitting out. Start with small portions on your first day to let your gut adjust.

## Should I Take a Food Tour or Eat on My Own?

A food tour is smart for your first time. Guides know which stalls have the best hygiene, which items are freshly made, and which lanes to skip. Group food tours in Old Delhi cost ₹1,500-3,500 per person and cover 8-12 tastings in 3-4 hours. After that first guided experience, you'll have the confidence to explore on your own.
