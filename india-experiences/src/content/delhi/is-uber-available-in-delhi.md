  - question: "Do I need an Indian phone number to use Uber in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Uber in India requires OTP (one-time password) verification sent to a phone number. Your home country number may work for booking, but drivers will call you on the registered number and you'll receive ride updates via SMS. An Indian SIM card makes everything smoother — get one at the Delhi airport arrivals hall from Airtel or Jio for ₹500-700 ($6-8.40). You can register your Indian number in the Uber app under settings."
  - question: "Is Ola or Uber cheaper in Delhi?"
    answer: "They're very close in pricing, usually within ₹10-20 of each other for the same route. Both use dynamic pricing, so one may be cheaper than the other at any given moment depending on demand. The smart move is to check both apps before booking and pick whichever is lower. Ola Auto tends to be slightly cheaper than Uber Auto for short trips. For longer rides, prices converge."
  - question: "What Uber options are available in Delhi?"
    answer: "Uber Go is the standard sedan option (₹100-400 for most city rides). Uber Auto books an auto-rickshaw at a fixed app price, eliminating haggling (₹40-150 for short-medium trips). Uber Premier offers higher-end sedans for more comfort. Uber XL provides larger vehicles for groups. Uber Moto is a motorcycle taxi for single riders — the cheapest and fastest option in traffic. All categories show the fare upfront before you book."

**Yes, Uber works across Delhi and is one of the easiest ways to get around the city.** Ola — India's homegrown equivalent — also operates everywhere and often has more drivers available. Download both apps before you arrive. You'll need an Indian SIM card for OTP verification, which you can pick up at the [airport when you land](/delhi/how-do-i-get-from-delhi-airport-to-the-city/).

## How Uber Works in Delhi

Uber in India operates the same way as everywhere else, with a few local additions:

**Uber Go** — Standard sedan (Maruti Swift, Hyundai i20, etc.). This is what most tourists use. Fares range from ₹100-400 ($1.20-4.80) for rides within the city.

**Uber Auto** — An auto-rickshaw booked through the app at a fixed price. This is brilliant because it eliminates the biggest hassle with Delhi autos: fare negotiation. A 5 km auto ride through the app costs ₹40-80 ($0.50-1), compared to the ₹150+ a street auto might demand from a tourist.

**Uber Moto** — A motorcycle taxi. Single rider only, and you'll need to be comfortable on the back of a bike in Delhi traffic. But it's the cheapest option (₹30-60 for short trips) and by far the fastest in heavy traffic.

**Uber Premier** — Higher-end sedans (Honda City, Toyota Etios). Worth it for airport runs or longer trips where you want more comfort. Costs about 30-40% more than Uber Go.

**Uber XL** — Larger vehicles (Toyota Innova, Ertiga) for groups of 4-6 people. Good for airport transfers with luggage or group sightseeing.

## Ola: The Other App You Need

Ola is India's ride-hailing company and has a larger driver pool than Uber in many parts of Delhi. The interface is similar, and it offers the same categories — Ola Mini (sedan), Ola Auto, Ola Bike, Ola Prime (premium).

**Why you should download both:** Availability and pricing fluctuate. Sometimes Uber shows a 10-minute wait and ₹350 while Ola shows a 3-minute wait and ₹280 for the same route. Checking both before booking saves you time and money consistently.

## The SIM Card Situation

Both Uber and Ola require a phone number for OTP (one-time password) verification — a security code sent by SMS every time you book. Your home country number technically works, but:

- You'll get charged international SMS rates
- Drivers call you when they arrive, and they won't call an international number
- SMS delivery to foreign numbers is unreliable

**The solution:** Get an Indian SIM card. Airtel and Jio have counters in the arrivals hall at Delhi's Terminal 3. A tourist SIM costs ₹500-700 ($6-8.40) for 28 days of data and calls. Read our full guide on [getting a SIM card in Delhi](/delhi/best-sim-card-for-tourists-in-delhi/).

Once you have an Indian number, add it to your Uber and Ola accounts under phone number settings. Drivers can call you, OTPs arrive instantly, and everything works smoothly.

## Typical Fares

Here are real fare ranges for common tourist routes (Uber Go, normal pricing):

| Route | Distance | Fare (₹) | Fare ($) |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Connaught Place to Red Fort | 7 km | 120-180 | 1.50-2.20 |
| CP to Humayun's Tomb | 8 km | 130-200 | 1.60-2.40 |
| CP to Qutub Minar | 16 km | 220-350 | 2.60-4.20 |
| CP to Hauz Khas | 12 km | 180-280 | 2.20-3.40 |
| Airport to CP | 22 km | 300-500 | 3.60-6 |
| Khan Market to Chandni Chowk | 9 km | 140-220 | 1.70-2.60 |

**Surge pricing** applies during rush hours (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM), rain, and late nights. Fares can jump 1.5-2.5x during heavy surges. If the price looks high, wait 10-15 minutes or switch to the metro.

## Tips for Using Ride-Hailing in Delhi

**Verify the car.** Check the number plate matches the app before getting in. Delhi traffic means multiple cars pull up at any pickup point. This is especially important at night.

**Share your ride.** Both apps have a trip-sharing feature that sends your live location to a contact. Use it, especially after dark.

**Sit in the back seat.** Standard practice in India. The front passenger seat is not expected.

**Cash or card.** Both apps accept cash, credit/debit cards, and UPI payments. Cash is reliable everywhere. Card payments occasionally fail with foreign cards. If you have Indian UPI (through Google Pay or PhonePe), that's the smoothest option.

**Pin your exact location.** Delhi addresses are confusing — "near Rajiv Chowk" could mean 10 different spots. Drop a pin on the map at your exact location rather than typing an address.

**For short hops, use Uber Auto.** It's cheaper than a car and faster in traffic. The driver navigates narrow lanes that sedans can't enter — useful in Old Delhi and market areas.

## When to Skip Uber and Use the Metro

The [Delhi Metro](/delhi/how-to-get-around-delhi/) is faster than Uber during rush hours, period. A metro ride from Rajiv Chowk to Chandni Chowk takes 5 minutes. The same route by car during evening rush can take 40-50 minutes. Use Uber for first-mile/last-mile connections from metro stations, late-night transport (metro closes at 11 PM), and routes not well-served by metro lines.

## Do I Need an Indian Phone Number to Use Uber in Delhi?

Yes. Uber in India requires OTP (one-time password) verification sent to a phone number. Your home country number may work for booking, but drivers will call you on the registered number and you'll receive ride updates via SMS. An Indian SIM card makes everything smoother — get one at the Delhi airport arrivals hall from Airtel or Jio for ₹500-700 ($6-8.40). You can register your Indian number in the Uber app under settings.

## Is Ola or Uber Cheaper in Delhi?

They're very close in pricing, usually within ₹10-20 of each other for the same route. Both use dynamic pricing, so one may be cheaper than the other at any given moment depending on demand. The smart move is to check both apps before booking and pick whichever is lower. Ola Auto tends to be slightly cheaper than Uber Auto for short trips. For longer rides, prices converge.
