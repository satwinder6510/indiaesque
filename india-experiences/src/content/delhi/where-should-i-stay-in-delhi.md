  - question: "What is the best area to stay in Delhi for first-time visitors?"
    answer: "Connaught Place (CP) is the best base for first-timers. It's centrally located with Rajiv Chowk metro station providing easy access to the Yellow and Blue lines. You're within 20-30 minutes of Old Delhi, South Delhi, and most major monuments. Hotels range from mid-range (₹2,500-5,000/night) to luxury. CP also has excellent restaurants, bars, and the inner circle's colonial architecture to explore on foot."
  - question: "Is Paharganj safe to stay in?"
    answer: "Paharganj is functional but rough around the edges. The main bazaar road is busy and reasonably safe during the day, but side lanes get uncomfortable after dark with aggressive touts, poor lighting, and sanitation issues. It's popular with backpackers for its ₹500-1,000/night rooms, but Karol Bagh and Majnu Ka Tila offer similar prices in cleaner, calmer settings. If you do stay in Paharganj, book a hotel on the main road and avoid wandering back lanes at night."
  - question: "Is South Delhi safe for tourists?"
    answer: "South Delhi is the safest part of the city for tourists. Neighbourhoods like Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Hauz Khas, and Vasant Vihar have wide roads, good lighting, regular police patrols, and active commercial areas. It's where most embassies, expat families, and wealthier locals are based. The trade-off is distance — you're 30-45 minutes from Old Delhi by metro, so sightseeing involves more commuting."

**Stay in Connaught Place if you want a central base, South Delhi if you prioritise safety and upscale dining, or Karol Bagh if you're on a budget.** Each area in Delhi has a different personality, price point, and set of trade-offs. Where you sleep shapes your entire experience of the city.

## Connaught Place (CP) — Best for First-Time Visitors

**Rajiv Chowk metro station** sits right under CP and connects the Yellow and Blue lines — the two most useful routes for tourists. From here, you're 15 minutes from Chandni Chowk (Old Delhi) and 25 minutes from Hauz Khas (South Delhi) by train.

CP's white colonial colonnades form a series of concentric circles filled with restaurants, bars, bookshops, and the occasional heritage building. The inner circle is walkable, and you can eat everything from street-side gol gappas to a proper meal at Farzi Cafe or Rajdhani.

**Price range:** Mid-range hotels cost ₹2,500-5,000/night. The Imperial (₹20,000+) is Delhi's grandest colonial hotel if you want to splurge. Bloomrooms CP is a solid modern option at ₹3,000-4,000.

**Downsides:** CP gets loud and crowded during the day. Touts patrol the outer circle targeting tourists. The neighbourhood empties out by 11 PM — the area between the outer circle and Minto Road feels deserted late at night.

For specifics on what to eat and do here, see our [Connaught Place guide](/delhi/things-to-do-in-connaught-place/).

## South Delhi — Safest and Most Comfortable

South Delhi is a sprawling area covering neighbourhoods from Lodhi Colony down to Saket. The areas most useful for tourists are:

**Defence Colony and Lajpat Nagar:** Well-connected (Defence Colony metro on the Violet Line), good mix of restaurants and markets. Lajpat Nagar's Central Market is one of Delhi's best for shopping. Hotels here run ₹2,000-4,000/night.

**Greater Kailash (GK1 and GK2):** Upscale residential with M Block Market in GK1 offering good cafes and restaurants. Quieter at night, well-lit, and feels genuinely safe. Hotels ₹3,000-6,000/night.

**Hauz Khas:** The area around Hauz Khas Village has bars, boutiques, and a lakeside park with 13th-century ruins. Green Park metro (Yellow Line) is the nearest station. Hotels and Airbnbs from ₹2,500-5,000/night.

**Saket:** Near Select Citywalk mall and the Garden of Five Senses. Saket metro station (Yellow Line) provides good connectivity. Hotels ₹2,500-5,000/night.

**The trade-off:** South Delhi is 30-45 minutes from Old Delhi by metro. If your itinerary is monument-heavy in central and north Delhi, you'll spend more time commuting. But the comfort, safety, and food make it worth considering, especially for longer stays.

## Karol Bagh — Best Budget Option

Karol Bagh is a dense commercial neighbourhood about 3 km west of CP. **Karol Bagh metro station** (Blue Line) connects you to Rajiv Chowk in 10 minutes. The area has hundreds of budget and mid-range hotels along Ajmal Khan Road and the surrounding streets.

**Price range:** Budget rooms from ₹800-1,500/night. Mid-range options ₹1,500-3,000. Hotels like Hotel Aura and Treebo Trend Palace Heights offer clean rooms with AC at reasonable rates.

**What's good:** Genuine street food everywhere — try the chaat at Roshan Di Kulfi on Ajmal Khan Road. The market is massive and focused on locals, so prices are real. You're well-connected by metro and surrounded by affordable restaurants.

**What's not:** Karol Bagh is crowded and noisy. Traffic on the main roads barely moves. The streets are narrow and packed with shoppers. It's not pretty, but it's functional and honest.

## Paharganj — Backpacker Strip (With Caveats)

Paharganj sits directly opposite New Delhi Railway Station, which is why it became the default backpacker base decades ago. Dorm beds start at ₹400-600, private rooms at ₹800-1,200.

**What draws people:** Rock-bottom prices, proximity to the railway station, a traveller social scene, and dozens of rooftop cafes.

**What they find:** Aggressive touts, mediocre sanitation, loud streets, and a general atmosphere that wears on you. The main bazaar road is functional during the day, but side lanes get genuinely unpleasant after dark.

Read our detailed breakdown on [whether Paharganj is worth staying in](/delhi/paharganj-is-it-worth-staying/). The short version: if you're experienced with budget travel in South Asia, it's fine. If this is your first time in India, stay in Karol Bagh instead and save yourself the culture shock.

## Aerocity — For Airport Layovers

If you have a long layover or an early morning flight, Aerocity's Worldmark complex is 5 minutes from Terminal 3. It's a cluster of chain hotels (Ibis, Holiday Inn, Pullman, JW Marriott) surrounded by restaurants and bars. Prices range from ₹3,000 (Ibis) to ₹15,000+ (JW Marriott) per night.

Aerocity is clean, modern, and completely sterile. It could be anywhere in the world. Stay here for convenience, not for Delhi character.

## Majnu Ka Tila — The Insider Pick

Delhi's Tibetan colony, officially the Aruna Nagar settlement near Vidhan Sabha metro station, is a low-key alternative to Paharganj. Small guesthouses charge ₹600-1,200/night in a calm, friendly neighbourhood with Tibetan restaurants, bookshops, and a pace that feels nothing like the rest of Delhi.

**Downsides:** It's in North Delhi, so South Delhi and Old Delhi monuments both require a 30-40 minute metro ride. The colony itself is compact, so once you've walked the lanes, you've seen it.

## Quick Comparison

| Area | Budget/Night | Metro Access | Safety | Vibe |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------|------|
| Connaught Place | ₹2,500-20,000+ | Excellent (Rajiv Chowk) | Good | Central, colonial, touristy |
| South Delhi | ₹2,500-15,000 | Good (multiple stations) | Best | Residential, upscale, calm |
| Karol Bagh | ₹800-3,000 | Good (Blue Line) | Decent | Local, commercial, busy |
| Paharganj | ₹400-1,500 | Walk to New Delhi station | Rough | Backpacker, gritty, loud |
| Aerocity | ₹3,000-15,000+ | Airport Express | Excellent | Corporate, sterile, convenient |
| Majnu Ka Tila | ₹600-1,200 | Fair (Vidhan Sabha) | Good | Tibetan, calm, off-radar |

## What Is the Best Area to Stay in Delhi for First-Time Visitors?

Connaught Place (CP) is the best base for first-timers. It's centrally located with Rajiv Chowk metro station providing easy access to the Yellow and Blue lines. You're within 20-30 minutes of Old Delhi, South Delhi, and most major monuments. Hotels range from mid-range (₹2,500-5,000/night) to luxury. CP also has excellent restaurants, bars, and the inner circle's colonial architecture to explore on foot.

## Is Paharganj Safe to Stay In?

Paharganj is functional but rough around the edges. The main bazaar road is busy and reasonably safe during the day, but side lanes get uncomfortable after dark with aggressive touts, poor lighting, and sanitation issues. It's popular with backpackers for its ₹500-1,000/night rooms, but Karol Bagh and Majnu Ka Tila offer similar prices in cleaner, calmer settings. If you do stay in Paharganj, book a hotel on the main road and avoid wandering back lanes at night.

## Is South Delhi Safe for Tourists?

South Delhi is the safest part of the city for tourists. Neighbourhoods like Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Hauz Khas, and Vasant Vihar have wide roads, good lighting, regular police patrols, and active commercial areas. It's where most embassies, expat families, and wealthier locals are based. The trade-off is distance — you're 30-45 minutes from Old Delhi by metro, so sightseeing involves more commuting.
