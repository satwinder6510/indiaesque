  - question: "Which month has the most festivals in Delhi?"
    answer: "October typically has the most festivals in Delhi. Navratri (nine nights of prayer and dance), Dussehra (effigy burning), Karva Chauth, and often Diwali all fall within this month. In years when Diwali falls in November, October still leads with Navratri and Dussehra. January is a close second with Lohri (13 Jan), Makar Sankranti (14 Jan), and Republic Day (26 Jan)."
  - question: "Should I plan my Delhi trip around a festival?"
    answer: "Yes, if you're flexible on dates. Experiencing a major festival adds a dimension to your Delhi trip that regular sightseeing can't match. The best festivals for tourists are Republic Day (spectacle, easy to attend), Holi at an organised event (unforgettable), and Diwali (atmospheric, though air quality is a concern). Book accommodation 6-8 weeks ahead for festival dates, and expect hotel prices to be 30-50% higher than normal."

**October through March is the best period to visit Delhi for festivals, with at least one major celebration every few weeks — Dussehra, Diwali, Christmas, Republic Day, Surajkund Mela, and Holi all fall within this six-month window.** This also happens to be Delhi's most comfortable season weather-wise, making it a win on every front.

Delhi's [year-round festival calendar](/delhi/what-festivals-are-celebrated-in-delhi/) is packed, but the October-March stretch concentrates the biggest and most tourist-friendly events into the same period when temperatures are mild and skies are mostly dry. Here's a month-by-month breakdown to help you plan.

## Month-by-Month Festival Calendar

### October — The Festival-Dense Month

**What's happening**: Navratri (nine nights), Dussehra, and sometimes Diwali

October is Delhi's most festival-packed month. Navratri — nine nights of prayer, fasting, and garba/dandiya dance — leads into Dussehra (Vijayadashami), when massive effigies of the demon king Ravana are burned across the city. The Ramlila performances (dramatisations of the epic Ramayana) run for 10+ days before Dussehra at multiple venues, including the historic Ramlila Maidan near Red Fort.

**Tourist-friendliness**: High. Dussehra effigy burnings are free, open-air, and spectacular. Ramlila shows are accessible even if you don't understand Hindi — the costumes, music, and staging tell the story visually.

**Weather**: Warm days (28-33 degrees C), cool evenings. Post-monsoon air quality is the cleanest it will be until March.

**Hotel impact**: Prices rise 20-30% around Dussehra and Diwali. Book in advance.

### November — Diwali (in Some Years) and Guru Nanak Jayanti

**What's happening**: Diwali (when it falls in November), Guru Nanak Jayanti

In years when Diwali falls in November (it alternates between October and November depending on the lunar calendar), the city transforms with lights, fireworks, and sweets. Even when Diwali is in October, November brings Guru Nanak Jayanti — the Sikh festival celebrating the birth of Guru Nanak — with processions and free community meals at gurdwaras across Delhi.

**Tourist-friendliness**: Diwali is extraordinary but comes with severe air quality — read our [Diwali guide](/delhi/diwali-in-delhi-what-to-expect/) for honest details. Guru Nanak Jayanti is peaceful and welcoming.

**Weather**: Cooling down (11-28 degrees C). Late November sees the start of winter smog.

**Hotel impact**: Diwali weeks see peak pricing. Post-Diwali rates drop.

### December — Christmas and New Year

**What's happening**: Christmas, New Year celebrations

Delhi's Christian community celebrates Christmas with services at churches like Sacred Heart Cathedral, St. James' Church (Kashmere Gate), and the Cathedral Church of the Redemption. Connaught Place, Khan Market, and major malls are decorated. Hotels host Christmas brunches and dinners — expect to pay ₹3,000-8,000 ($36-96) per person at five-star properties.

New Year celebrations centre on restaurants, hotels, and house parties. Delhi's nightlife scene ramps up, and most upscale venues host ticketed events.

**Tourist-friendliness**: Very high. Christmas in Delhi is relaxed and commercial rather than chaotic. Good for families.

**Weather**: Cold mornings (4-8 degrees C), pleasant afternoons (18-22 degrees C). Peak pollution month — check AQI daily.

**Hotel impact**: Peak tourist season pricing. Book early, especially for Christmas week.

### January — Lohri and Republic Day

**What's happening**: Lohri (13 Jan), Makar Sankranti (14 Jan), Republic Day (26 Jan)

January opens with Lohri, the Punjabi bonfire festival, followed by Makar Sankranti (a harvest festival marked with kite flying and sesame sweets). Then comes the main event: Republic Day on 26 January, when the military parade on Kartavya Path showcases India's armed forces with tanks, missiles, fighter jets, and cultural floats. Our [Republic Day guide](/delhi/what-happens-on-republic-day-in-delhi/) covers tickets, timing, and what to expect.

**Tourist-friendliness**: Republic Day is the single most accessible festival experience in Delhi. Buy a ticket, show up early, and watch. No cultural preparation needed.

**Weather**: Delhi's coldest month. Morning fog, daytime highs around 18-20 degrees C. Wrap up warm for the early-morning parade.

**Hotel impact**: Republic Day week sees high demand, especially in central Delhi hotels near the parade route.

### February — Surajkund Mela and Basant Panchami

**What's happening**: Surajkund International Crafts Mela (1-15 Feb), Basant Panchami

February's star event is the [Surajkund Mela](/delhi/what-is-surajkund-mela/) — a two-week crafts fair in Faridabad (30 minutes from Delhi) featuring artisans from every Indian state and a dozen international countries. Entry is ₹180 ($2.15), and the combination of handicraft shopping, regional food stalls, and cultural performances makes it one of Delhi's best festival experiences.

Basant Panchami marks the arrival of spring. People wear yellow, fly kites, and visit Saraswati temples. Quiet but beautiful.

**Tourist-friendliness**: Surajkund Mela is extremely tourist-friendly — no religious or cultural knowledge needed, just show up and browse.

**Weather**: February is arguably [Delhi's best month](/delhi/what-is-the-best-month-to-visit-delhi/). Mild temperatures (8-24 degrees C), improving air quality, and flowering trees.

**Hotel impact**: Moderate. February is popular but not as competitive as October-January.

### March — Holi

**What's happening**: Holi (date varies, usually mid-March)

The festival of colours closes out the peak festival season. People throw coloured powder and water at each other in a celebration of spring. In Delhi, the [best Holi experiences for tourists](/delhi/where-to-celebrate-holi-in-delhi/) are at organised hotel events or ticketed music festivals rather than street celebrations.

**Tourist-friendliness**: Moderate to high — depends entirely on where you celebrate. Organised events are excellent. Random street Holi can be chaotic.

**Weather**: Warming up (13-30 degrees C). By late March, summer is approaching.

**Hotel impact**: Holi doesn't drive hotel prices as much as Diwali or Republic Day. Booking 3-4 weeks ahead is sufficient.

## Which Festivals Are Most Tourist-Friendly?

If you can only plan around one festival, here's how they rank for international visitors:

1. **Republic Day** — spectacular, well-organised, and requires no cultural background to appreciate. A military parade is universally impressive.
2. **Surajkund Mela** — the easiest festival experience. Shopping, eating, and watching performances with zero language barrier.
3. **Holi** (at an organised event) — an unforgettable sensory experience. Choose your venue carefully and you'll have one of the most unique days of your life.
4. **Dussehra** — the burning of giant Ravana effigies is dramatic and free to attend. Multiple venues across Delhi.
5. **Diwali** — visually stunning but air quality is a real issue. Best for experienced India travellers who know how to manage the pollution.
6. **Christmas** — familiar for Western visitors but Delhi adds its own flavour. Good for families.

## Peak vs. Shoulder Season Trade-Offs

**Peak festival season (October-January)**: You get the biggest events, but you also get the highest hotel prices, biggest crowds at monuments, and (in November-January) the worst air quality. This is when Delhi is at its most intense.

**Shoulder festival season (February-March)**: Fewer blockbuster festivals, but the weather is better, pollution clears, and hotel prices ease. Surajkund Mela and Holi are both excellent. If you want festivals plus comfortable sightseeing without battling crowds and smog, February is the sweet spot.

**Off-season (April-September)**: Festivals still happen — Eid, Baisakhi, Janmashtami, Independence Day — but the extreme heat (April-June) or monsoon rain (July-September) makes outdoor celebrations less pleasant. Hotel prices drop significantly, and these are genuine cultural experiences if you can handle the weather.

## Which Month Has the Most Festivals in Delhi?

October typically has the most festivals in Delhi. Navratri (nine nights of prayer and dance), Dussehra (effigy burning), Karva Chauth, and often Diwali all fall within this month. In years when Diwali falls in November, October still leads with Navratri and Dussehra. January is a close second with Lohri (13 Jan), Makar Sankranti (14 Jan), and Republic Day (26 Jan).

## Should I Plan My Delhi Trip Around a Festival?

Yes, if you're flexible on dates. Experiencing a major festival adds a dimension to your Delhi trip that regular sightseeing can't match. The best festivals for tourists are Republic Day (spectacle, easy to attend), Holi at an organised event (unforgettable), and Diwali (atmospheric, though air quality is a concern). Book accommodation 6-8 weeks ahead for festival dates, and expect hotel prices to be 30-50% higher than normal.
