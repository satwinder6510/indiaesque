- **Lights:** Monuments and buildings illuminated. India Gate area and Connaught Place are beautifully lit.
- **Fireworks:** Non-stop from sunset. Spectacular but also the cause of severe air pollution.
- **Business closures:** Many shops close on main Diwali day. Restaurants may have limited service.

**For tourists:**
- Book hotels months ahead — prices spike 50-100%
- Flights in/out of Delhi are expensive and busy

- Best experienced at a local home if you can get an invitation
- Hotels host Diwali dinners with traditional food and music

**Tips:**
- Visit markets before Diwali day for the buzz
- Watch fireworks from a rooftop (hotels often open theirs)
