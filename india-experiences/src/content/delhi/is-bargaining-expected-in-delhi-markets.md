  - question: "Do you bargain in Delhi markets?"
    answer: "Yes, bargaining is expected in all of Delhi's street and bazaar markets, including Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, Janpath, and Lajpat Nagar. Start at about 50% of the asking price and work toward 60-70%. Fixed-price shops, malls, government emporiums, and branded stores do not allow bargaining."
  - question: "How much should I bargain in Delhi?"
    answer: "A good rule is to start at 50% of the quoted price and settle at 60-70%. If the vendor says ₹1,000, offer ₹500 and expect to land around ₹600-700. This varies — tourist-heavy markets like Janpath inflate prices more, so you might push harder. In less touristy bazaars, vendors start closer to fair value."
  - question: "Where should you not bargain in Delhi?"
    answer: "Don't bargain in shopping malls, branded retail stores, government emporiums like the Central Cottage Industries Emporium, grocery stores, restaurants, or at Dilli Haat's food stalls. Dilli Haat's craft stalls allow light negotiation but vendors there price more fairly than street markets."

**Yes, bargaining is completely normal in Delhi's street markets — vendors expect it, and their opening prices are set with negotiation in mind.** A good starting offer is 50% of the asking price, and you'll usually settle somewhere around 60-70%. If you pay the first quoted price, you're almost certainly overpaying.

## Where Bargaining Works

Bargaining is standard in these Delhi markets:

- **Chandni Chowk** — all lanes and sub-markets
- **Sarojini Nagar** — especially for clothes and accessories
- **Janpath Market** — vendors here quote high for tourists
- **Lajpat Nagar** — Central Market area
- **Paharganj** — Main Bazaar near New Delhi Railway Station
- **Karol Bagh** — Ajmal Khan Road and Gaffar Market
- **Tibetan Market** near Majnu Ka Tilla

At [Dilli Haat](/delhi/what-is-dilli-haat/), light bargaining is acceptable at the craft stalls, though vendors there tend to price more reasonably than street markets. The food stalls inside are fixed price.

## Where You Should Not Bargain

These places have fixed prices and bargaining will get you nowhere (or odd looks):

- **Shopping malls** — Select Citywalk, DLF Promenade, Ambience Mall
- **Branded stores** — Fabindia, FabAlley, Forest Essentials, Zara, H&M
- **Government emporiums** — Central Cottage Industries Emporium on Janpath Road, State Emporiums on Baba Kharak Singh Marg
- **Khan Market** — most shops here have fixed prices, though a few smaller stalls may negotiate
- **Grocery stores and pharmacies**
- **Restaurants and cafes**

## How to Bargain: A Practical Guide

**Step 1: Ask the price first.** Don't show too much enthusiasm for the item. Pick it up, look at it casually, and ask "kitna hai?" (how much?). The vendor will quote a price.

**Step 2: Counter at 50%.** If they say ₹1,000, offer ₹500. They'll act shocked — this is theatre, not genuine offence. They'll counter at maybe ₹800.

**Step 3: Work toward the middle.** Go back and forth. ₹550 from you, ₹750 from them, ₹600 from you. Most transactions settle at 60-70% of the opening ask.

**Step 4: Walk away if needed.** The single most effective bargaining tool is turning to leave. If the vendor calls you back with a lower price, you know there's still margin. If they let you go, you were probably already at a fair price.

**Step 5: Pay and move on.** Once you've agreed on a price, don't try to push lower. Shake on it and pay.

## Tips That Actually Help

**Compare prices first.** Walk past 3-4 stalls selling the same item before you start negotiating. This gives you a baseline for what the item actually costs.

**Buy multiples for a discount.** Vendors are more flexible on price if you're buying several items. "I'll take three scarves — what's your best price?" works better than haggling over one scarf.

**Carry small bills.** If you offer ₹500 from a ₹500 note after agreeing on ₹500, the deal is clean. If you hand over ₹2,000 and wait for change, some vendors will revisit the price.

**Be friendly, not aggressive.** Bargaining in Delhi is social. Smile, chat, take the offered chai. The vendors who enjoy the interaction often give better prices than the ones you bulldoze.

**Know when it doesn't matter.** If you're arguing over ₹50-100 ($0.60-1.20) on a scarf, that's less than a dollar to you and a meaningful amount to the vendor. Find a price that feels fair to both sides and call it done.

## Bargaining by Market

| Market | Starting Markup | Your Target |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Chandni Chowk | 30-50% over fair price | Start at 50%, settle at 65-75% |
| Sarojini Nagar | 20-40% over fair price | Start at 50%, settle at 70-80% |
| Janpath | 50-100% over fair price | Start at 40%, settle at 50-60% |
| Lajpat Nagar | 30-50% over fair price | Start at 50%, settle at 65-75% |
| Dilli Haat | 10-20% over fair price | Ask for 10-15% off, accept small discounts |

Janpath has the highest markups because it caters to foreign tourists almost exclusively. Sarojini Nagar is more of a local market, so opening prices are closer to reality.
