**Yes, Delhi has organised pub crawls and — better yet — neighbourhoods where you can easily do your own.** Hauz Khas Village packs 15+ bars into a single walkable lane, and Connaught Place's outer circle has enough lounges and pubs to keep you moving all night.

Organised crawls come and go. The DIY approach is more reliable and lets you skip any place that doesn't feel right. Here's how both work.

## Organised Pub Crawls

A handful of operators and social groups run group pub crawls, mostly on **Friday and Saturday nights**. The format is standard: meet at a central point, hit 3-4 bars together over 4 hours, one included drink at each stop, and a guide who handles the logistics.

**Where to find them:**

- **Insider.in** — search for "pub crawl Delhi" to find upcoming ticketed events
- **Meetup.com** — Delhi social groups (Internations Delhi, Delhi Expats) organise crawls semi-regularly
- **Instagram** — Local event pages like @delhifoodwalks and @socialdelhi occasionally promote crawl events

**Cost:** ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) per person, usually including one drink per venue and sometimes a snack plate at one stop.

**Common routes:** Most organised crawls hit **Connaught Place** (N Block and M Block on the outer circle) or the **Hauz Khas Village** strip. CP crawls tend to be more upmarket — cocktail bars and lounges. Hauz Khas crawls are louder and younger.

The main advantage of an organised crawl is meeting other travellers. If you're solo, it beats drinking alone. The main drawback is being locked into a schedule and venues you might not have chosen.

## DIY Pub Crawl: Hauz Khas Village

This is the move. [Hauz Khas Village](/delhi/things-to-do-in-hauz-khas/) is a narrow, pedestrianised lane lined with bars, restaurants, and cafes stacked three storeys high. You can hit 4-5 places in an evening without walking more than 200 metres.

### Suggested Route

**Start: 8:00pm** at the top of the village near the main road.

**Stop 1 — Social, Hauz Khas** — A large, multi-level space with good cocktails (₹450-600) and a rooftop with views over Hauz Khas lake and the medieval ruins. Good vibe early in the evening before the DJ kicks in.

**Stop 2 — Imperfecto** — Bohemian decor, strong sangria (₹500 a pitcher to share), and a menu that covers everything from hummus to butter chicken. Grab a table on the terrace.

**Stop 3 — Raasta** — Reggae-themed bar with ₹250-350 beers and a laid-back atmosphere. Less pretentious than some of the village spots. Gets lively after 10pm.

**Stop 4 — Out of the Box** — For [craft beer](/delhi/where-to-drink-craft-beer-in-delhi/). Rotating taps with Indian microbrews for ₹300-500 a pint. If you've been drinking cocktails all night, a good pale ale is a reset.

**End: 12:30am** — Last call hits around this time. Most places in Hauz Khas shut by 1:00am sharp. Book an Uber back — auto-rickshaws are scarce this late.

### Hauz Khas Tips

- **No cover charge** at most bars, but some enforce a ₹1,000-1,500 minimum spend per person on weekends.
- **Stag entry** (men without women) is restricted or charged extra at a few venues on weekends. Groups or couples won't have issues.
- **Dress code** is smart casual. No flip-flops or shorts at the posher spots.
- The lane gets **genuinely crowded** after 10pm on Saturdays. If you want a table, arrive by 8:30pm or book ahead.

## DIY Pub Crawl: Connaught Place

CP's outer circle, particularly **N Block and M Block**, has a strip of bars and lounges that work for a more upscale crawl.

**Unplugged Courtyard** — Live music venue with cover bands playing Bollywood and classic rock. ₹500-800 cocktails. Energetic.

**Lord of the Drinks** — Massive multi-floor bar with something for everyone. Decent bar food.

**The Beer Cafe** — 50+ beers on tap, including Indian craft options. Casual, no-pressure spot to start or end.

**Farzi Cafe** — Molecular gastronomy cocktails (₹600-900) and inventive bar snacks. More of a sit-down vibe than a pub crawl stop, but worth one drink.

These are all within a 10-minute walk of each other on the outer circle. **Rajiv Chowk metro** (Blue/Yellow Line) drops you right in the centre.

## What You Need To Know

**Closing time:** 1:00am across Delhi. A few Gurgaon clubs push to 2-3am. For more on the scene, see our full [Delhi nightlife guide](/delhi/best-nightlife-in-delhi/).

**Drink prices:** Beer ₹250-500, cocktails ₹400-800, wine ₹500-900. Delhi isn't cheap for drinking — alcohol taxes are steep.

**ID:** Carry your passport or a photocopy. Some venues check ID at the door, especially if you look young.

**Getting home:** Uber and Ola work well until 2am. Book before last call — surge pricing kicks in around midnight on weekends. Don't take street autos late at night.

**Drinking age:** 25 in Delhi. Yes, 25 — one of the highest in the world. In practice, enforcement at bars is inconsistent, but it's the legal line.
