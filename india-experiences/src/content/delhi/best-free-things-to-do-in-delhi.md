**Delhi has more free things worth doing than most cities charge for — Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, Lodhi Gardens, the Lodhi Art District, India Gate, Sunder Nursery, and dozens of unticketeted monuments are all completely free.** You could fill three days without spending a rupee on entry fees.

## Gurudwara Bangla Sahib

This is one of the most powerful places in Delhi, and it costs nothing. The massive Sikh gurudwara near Connaught Place is recognisable by its golden dome and the sarovar (sacred pool) that reflects it. You're welcome regardless of your faith — just cover your head (free scarves are available at the entrance) and remove your shoes.

The real experience here is the langar — the communal kitchen that serves free meals to anyone who walks in, 24 hours a day. On busy days, the kitchen feeds over 10,000 people. You sit on the floor in long rows, and volunteers serve dal, roti, and sabzi. The food is simple and good, and the scale of the operation is extraordinary.

**Getting there:** Near Gole Market, 10-minute walk from Rajiv Chowk metro (Yellow/Blue Line). Open 24 hours.

## Lodhi Gardens

A 90-acre park in central Delhi containing five major 15th-century monuments — the tombs of Muhammad Shah and Sikandar Lodhi, Bara Gumbad mosque and tomb, and the Sheesh Gumbad. The monuments sit among lawns, walking paths, and old trees, and the park is used by joggers, yoga practitioners, and families from dawn to dusk.

The architecture here is Lodhi and Sayyid dynasty — late Sultanate period, before the Mughals arrived. The proportions are simpler than Mughal buildings but still striking, especially Bara Gumbad with its ornate plasterwork.

**Best time:** Early morning (6-8 AM) when the park is cool and quiet. Avoid Sunday afternoons when it gets packed.

**Getting there:** Main entrance on Lodhi Road, near the India International Centre. Nearest metro is Jor Bagh (Yellow Line), 800m walk.

## Lodhi Art District

A kilometre of street art along Lodhi Colony, between Lodhi Gardens and Khanna Market. International and Indian artists have painted entire building facades, compound walls, and pillars with large-scale murals. The project started in 2015 and has grown into India's first open-air public art district.

Walk south from Lodhi Gardens along Lodhi Colony's residential streets. The murals change every couple of years, so what you see will be different from older blog posts. The [street art guide](/delhi/where-to-see-street-art-in-delhi/) has a walking map.

**Best time:** Morning light for photography. Weekdays for fewer people.

## India Gate and Kartavya Path

The 42-metre war memorial arch at the eastern end of Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath) is Delhi's most visited landmark. It's a memorial to 70,000 Indian soldiers who died in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The lawns surrounding India Gate fill up every evening with families, ice cream vendors, and balloon sellers.

Walk west along Kartavya Path toward Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President's house) for the full scale of Lutyens' New Delhi — the 3-km ceremonial boulevard lined with gardens and water channels, framed by the Secretariat buildings and the presidential palace.

**Getting there:** Nearest metro is Central Secretariat (Yellow/Violet Line), 15-minute walk east. Or Udyog Bhawan (Yellow Line), 10-minute walk.

## Sunder Nursery

A 90-acre Mughal heritage garden adjacent to Humayun's Tomb, restored and opened to the public in 2018 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. The park contains 15 restored monuments, formal gardens with native plants, a lake, nursery greenhouses, and walking paths through what was once a royal plant nursery.

It's one of the best-maintained green spaces in Delhi and far quieter than Lodhi Gardens. The monuments inside include Sunderwala Mahal, Sunderwala Burj, and several unidentified Mughal-era tombs.

**Getting there:** Entrance on Mathura Road, opposite the Nizamuddin police station. Nearest metro is JLN Stadium (Violet Line), then auto-rickshaw for ₹30-40.

## Agrasen ki Baoli

A 14th-century stepwell on Hailey Road, just east of Connaught Place. The 60-metre stone staircase descends 15 metres underground, lined with 108 arched niches across three levels. It was featured in the Bollywood film PK and has become a popular photography spot.

Free entry, open sunrise to sunset. Read the full guide: [What is Agrasen ki Baoli?](/delhi/what-is-agrasen-ki-baoli/)

**Getting there:** Barakhamba Road metro (Blue Line), 5-minute walk.

## Jama Masjid

India's largest mosque, built by Shah Jahan in 1656, is free to enter. The main courtyard holds 25,000 worshippers during Friday prayers. The red sandstone and marble structure has three gates, four towers, and two 40-metre minarets. You can climb the southern minaret for ₹100 ($1.20) for a panoramic view of Old Delhi — that's the only cost.

**Note:** ₹300 camera fee if you bring a camera (phones are usually fine). Dress modestly — sleeveless tops and shorts are not allowed. Free robes are available if needed.

**Getting there:** Chawri Bazaar metro (Yellow Line), 10-minute walk north. Or walk south from Red Fort.

## Mehrauli Archaeological Park

Over 200 monuments spanning 1,000 years of history, spread across an overgrown forested area adjacent to Qutub Minar. Balban's Tomb (the first true arch built on Indian soil), Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb, Rajon ki Baoli (a five-storey stepwell), and dozens of unnamed tombs and walls. Free entry, barely any visitors. See our full guide on [Mehrauli Archaeological Park](/delhi/what-is-mehrauli-archaeological-park/).

## Other Free Experiences

**Nizamuddin Dargah** — The 14th-century Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Free entry, open to all faiths. Thursday evening qawwali performances are free and run from about 7 PM.

**Laxminarayan Temple (Birla Mandir)** — A large Hindu temple on Mandir Marg, built in 1939 and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi. Free entry. No cameras allowed inside.

**National Museum** — On Janpath near India Gate. Entry was made free in 2023. The collection covers 5,000 years of Indian art, sculpture, and textiles.

**Dilli Haat** — The open-air handicraft market at INA metro station is not technically free — entry is ₹30 ($0.35) for Indians, ₹100 ($1.20) for foreigners — but it's close enough. Regional food stalls and handicraft shops from every Indian state.

The [heritage walks](/delhi/heritage-walks/) route through many of these sites in a logical sequence. Self-guided walks cost nothing beyond your time and metro fare.

## Is Dilli Haat Free to Enter?

Not quite free — Dilli Haat at INA charges a nominal entry fee of ₹30 ($0.35) for Indian nationals and ₹100 ($1.20) for foreign visitors. It's a government-run open-air handicraft market with food stalls from every Indian state. Given the entry fee is less than a cup of chai at most cafes, it still qualifies as one of Delhi's cheapest outings.

Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, Akshardham Temple, Laxminarayan Temple (Birla Mandir), ISKCON Temple, and Chhatarpur Temple charge no entry fee.
