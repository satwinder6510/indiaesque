  - question: "Is Agrasen ki Baoli haunted?"
    answer: "Locals say so, and it has that reputation — especially the lower levels near the water, where the light gets dim and the air goes cold. The ASI officially closes the baoli by evening. The atmosphere is undeniably eerie, with the stepped walls closing in as you descend. But haunted? That depends on how suggestible you are. It's a beautiful piece of medieval engineering either way."
  - question: "How do I get to Agrasen ki Baoli?"
    answer: "The baoli is on Hailey Road, between Connaught Place and Barakhamba Road. The nearest metro station is Barakhamba Road (Blue Line), about a 5-minute walk south. From Connaught Place's inner circle, walk east along Tolstoy Marg and turn left on Hailey Road — the baoli is behind a small park on the right side. Google Maps has the location pinned accurately."
  - question: "How long do you need at Agrasen ki Baoli?"
    answer: "About 20-30 minutes. The baoli is a single structure — you walk down the steps, explore the three levels of arched corridors, take photos, and walk back up. There's no museum or surrounding complex. Combine it with Connaught Place (10 minutes away) and Jantar Mantar (15 minutes walk) to fill a morning."

**Agrasen ki Baoli is a 14th-century stepwell in the middle of central Delhi, just off Connaught Place — a 60-metre long, 15-metre deep stone staircase descending into the earth, lined with 108 arched niches across three levels.** Entry is free, it takes 20-30 minutes to explore, and it's one of the most atmospheric places in the city.

## What You're Looking At

A baoli (also spelled "baori") is a stepwell — a type of water storage and retrieval system common across North India and Rajasthan from the medieval period onward. Before municipal water supplies, baolis served as community water sources, and their stepped design allowed people to walk down to the water level as it rose and fell with the seasons.

Agrasen ki Baoli is 60 metres long and 15 metres wide, built of grey stone with no embellishment or carving. It descends through 103 steps, flanked by walls that grow taller as you go deeper. Three levels of arched corridors (called galleries) line the western wall, originally used as rooms for resting, bathing, and socialising.

The baoli is attributed to the legendary king Agrasen, though the current structure dates to the 14th century — likely built during the Tughlaq period and renovated in the Lodhi era. It was rediscovered in the modern era buried under rubble and squatters, and the Archaeological Survey of India restored and listed it as a protected monument.

## Why People Come Here

**Photography.** The symmetrical arches, the descending perspective, and the play of light and shadow make this one of Delhi's most photogenic structures. The light is best in the morning when the sun enters from the east and illuminates the upper galleries. Photographers line up along the central staircase for the depth-of-field shot looking downward.

**The Bollywood connection.** Agrasen ki Baoli appeared in the Aamir Khan film PK (2014) and Sultan (2016), which put it on the tourist map. Before that, it was known mainly to architecture students and history walkers.

**The atmosphere.** The temperature drops noticeably as you descend. The walls close in. The noise from Hailey Road above fades. By the lowest level, you're surrounded by damp stone, green moss, and the occasional pigeon. It feels ancient and slightly unsettling — which is part of the appeal.

**It's free.** No ticket, no queue, no camera fee. You walk in through a small gate, explore at your own pace, and leave.

## Visiting Details

- **Entry:** Free
- **Hours:** Open daily, sunrise to sunset (approximately 7 AM to 5:30 PM in winter, 6 AM to 7 PM in summer)
- **Location:** Hailey Road, between Connaught Place and Barakhamba Road
- **Metro:** Barakhamba Road (Blue Line), 5-minute walk south. Or Rajiv Chowk (Yellow/Blue Line), 10-minute walk east
- **Time needed:** 20-30 minutes
- **Best time:** Morning, weekdays. The baoli gets busy on weekends with Instagram photographers and selfie-takers

## Practical Tips

**Go early on weekdays.** The baoli is small, and even 20 visitors can make it feel crowded. Tuesday and Wednesday mornings before 10 AM are quietest.

**Watch your step.** The stone steps can be slippery, especially in monsoon season when moss grows on the lower levels. Wear shoes with grip.

**Bring a wide-angle lens.** The standard phone camera doesn't capture the depth. If you have even a basic wide-angle attachment, use it — the symmetry of the descending arches is the shot.

**Don't skip the lower levels.** Most visitors take photos from the top and leave. Walk all the way down. The galleries on the western wall have arched rooms you can enter, and the atmosphere at the bottom is completely different from the top.

## What to Combine It With

Agrasen ki Baoli is in the heart of [Connaught Place](/delhi/things-to-do-in-connaught-place/), so you're surrounded by things to do:

**Jantar Mantar** — The 18th-century astronomical observation park is a 15-minute walk west on Sansad Marg. Entry is ₹25/₹200. The sundials and celestial instruments are genuinely fascinating and take about 30 minutes.

**Connaught Place** — Walk 10 minutes west to the inner circle for coffee at Wenger's (operating since 1926), books at The Bookshop on Janpath, or a meal at Saravana Bhavan for South Indian dosas.

**National Museum** — 20 minutes south on Janpath Road. Free entry. One of India's largest museums with collections spanning 5,000 years.
