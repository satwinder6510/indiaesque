**Delhi Metro fares cost ₹10-60 ($0.12-0.72) per ride, and about seven stations cover nearly every major tourist sight in the city.** The network is colour-coded, well-signed in English, and easy to navigate once you know which lines to use.

Here's a station-by-station breakdown of where you'll actually go, plus the tips that make the difference between a smooth ride and a frustrating one.

## The Stations You'll Actually Use

### Rajiv Chowk (Yellow + Blue Line)

This is Delhi's busiest station and the one you'll pass through the most. It sits directly under **Connaught Place (CP)** — the circular colonial-era commercial district in central Delhi. Exit here for restaurants, shopping, Jantar Mantar, and Agrasen ki Baoli. It's also where the Yellow and Blue lines cross, making it the primary interchange for north-south and east-west travel.

**Warning:** Rajiv Chowk during rush hour (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM) is intensely crowded. If you can, avoid transiting here between those times.

### Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line)

Your gateway to Old Delhi. Exit Gate 3 for the main **Chandni Chowk** bazaar road, or Gate 1 for **Red Fort**. From here you're walking distance to Paranthe Wali Gali, the Spice Market (Khari Baoli), and Jama Masjid.

This station gets busy by mid-morning as shoppers flood in. Arrive before 9 AM for a calmer experience. Read our guide to [things to do in Old Delhi](/delhi/things-to-do-in-old-delhi-chandni-chowk/) for a full breakdown of the area.

### Kashmere Gate (Yellow + Red + Violet Line)

The biggest interchange station in the network where three lines meet. You probably won't have a destination here — Kashmere Gate is mostly useful for switching lines. The Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT) is nearby if you're heading to Agra, Jaipur, or Rishikesh by bus.

### Hauz Khas (Yellow + Magenta Line)

South Delhi's main station for nightlife, Deer Park, and the Hauz Khas Complex ruins. Exit and walk 10 minutes south to reach the bars and restaurants of Hauz Khas Village. The Magenta Line connection here also gives you a route to the airport without going through Rajiv Chowk.

### New Delhi (Yellow + Airport Express)

Located near Paharganj and the New Delhi Railway Station. The main reason to come here is the **Airport Express Line** — a dedicated service that runs to Terminal 3 of IGI Airport in 20 minutes for ₹60 ($0.72). Trains depart every 10-15 minutes.

### Qutub Minar (Yellow Line)

Exit here for the **Qutub Minar** complex, Delhi's oldest monument and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The complex is a 5-minute walk from the station.

### Jor Bagh (Yellow Line)

The closest station to **Lodhi Gardens** — Delhi's most pleasant green space, filled with 15th-century tombs and walking paths. Also handy for **Khan Market**, which is a 10-minute walk east.

## Fares and Tickets

| Journey Type | Cost |
|---|---|
| Minimum fare (1-2 km) | ₹10 ($0.12) |
| Average tourist trip | ₹20-30 ($0.24-0.36) |
| Cross-city journey | ₹40-60 ($0.48-0.72) |
| Airport Express (New Delhi to T3) | ₹60 ($0.72) |
| Smart card discount | 10% off all journeys |

A **Metro smart card** makes sense if you're riding 4+ times. It costs ₹150 ($1.80) — ₹50 refundable deposit plus ₹100 starting balance. More details in our [how to use the Delhi Metro](/delhi/how-to-use-delhi-metro/) guide.

## Line-by-Line Overview for Tourists

**Yellow Line** — the most important. Runs north-south from Samaypur Badli through Chandni Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Hauz Khas, and down to HUDA City Centre in Gurgaon. Covers Old Delhi, central Delhi, and South Delhi.

**Blue Line** — runs east-west. Useful for Karol Bagh (budget shopping), Rajiv Chowk, and Noida. You'll use this less unless you're staying in West Delhi.

**Magenta Line** — connects Hauz Khas to Janakpuri West, passing near the airport. Useful alternative route to IGI Airport if you're in South Delhi.

**Orange Line (Airport Express)** — the dedicated airport line from New Delhi station. Fast, spacious, and rarely crowded. Worth the ₹60 for the convenience.

**Violet Line** — connects Kashmere Gate to southern suburbs. Stop at INA for INA Market or Dilli Haat.

## Practical Tips That Matter

**Download the DMRC app** before you arrive. It has an offline map, fare calculator, and first/last train times for every station.

**Google Maps integrates Metro routing.** Search for your destination and select transit — it'll show Metro options with walking connections.

**Avoid Rajiv Chowk interchange during rush hour.** If you need to switch from Yellow to Blue Line, consider doing it at a less crowded station when possible.

**Keep your token or card accessible.** You need it to exit, and fumbling at the gate with a queue behind you isn't fun.

**Use the right exit.** Large stations have multiple exits numbered and labelled. Google Maps usually specifies which exit is closest to your destination.
