  - question: "How cold does Delhi get in winter?"
    answer: "Delhi winters run from November to February. December and January are the coldest months, with nighttime lows of 3-7°C (37-45°F) and daytime highs of 18-22°C (64-72°F). Early mornings are genuinely cold and often foggy. By midday, the sun warms things up enough for comfortable sightseeing in a light jacket. February starts warming and rarely drops below 8°C at night."
  - question: "What is the best winter month to visit Delhi?"
    answer: "November is the best winter month overall — clear skies, comfortable temperatures (15-28°C), manageable pollution after Diwali clears, and no fog. December and January are colder and foggier but have Republic Day (January 26) and peak festival season. February offers warming weather and Surajkund Mela. Avoid the last two weeks of November if pollution concerns you — post-Diwali smog can be intense."

**Winter is the best time to visit Delhi --- full stop.** From November through February, temperatures drop to a comfortable 15-22°C during the day, every outdoor space becomes usable, and the city runs at its best. If you're planning a Delhi trip and have any flexibility on timing, aim for this window.

The winter calendar also stacks up: Republic Day parade in January, Surajkund Mela in February, seasonal street food that only appears in cold weather, and clear skies (most days) that make the Mughal monuments glow. Here's everything worth doing.

## Outdoor Walks and Gardens

### Lodhi Gardens

Delhi's finest park transforms in winter. Cool air, golden afternoon light, and 15th-century Mughal tombs scattered across 90 acres of old trees and manicured lawns. The stretch near **Bara Gumbad** is the most photogenic, especially between 3:30-5:00pm when the sun drops low.

Enter from **Jor Bagh metro** (Yellow Line). Free entry, open sunrise to 8pm. Morning walks here in January --- when mist settles between the tombs --- feel like stepping into a period film. Bring a light jacket for early morning visits.

### Sunder Nursery

Adjacent to Humayun's Tomb, this restored Mughal-era garden has palm-lined avenues, rose gardens in full winter bloom, water channels, and heritage structures. It's more manicured and less crowded than Lodhi Gardens. Entry ₹30 ($0.35). In winter, the rose section peaks in January and February --- over 100 varieties in flower.

### Mehrauli Archaeological Park

A sprawling complex of ruins spanning 1,000 years of Delhi history, near Qutub Minar. Winter afternoons are perfect for wandering the crumbling Mughal tombs, Lodi-era structures, and overgrown pathways. Free entry. Very few tourists make it here, even in peak season.

## Old Delhi Food Tours

Winter is when Delhi's street food scene reaches its peak. The cold weather makes standing at outdoor stalls comfortable rather than punishing, and several dishes only appear from November to February.

### Daulat Ki Chaat

This seasonal delicacy appears on the streets of Old Delhi only in winter, usually from December through February. Made from fresh milk foam collected before dawn, sweetened with sugar, saffron, and pistachios, it melts on your tongue like sweet air. Vendors set up near **Chawri Bazaar metro** and along **Chandni Chowk** from around 7am. Once the morning sun hits, the foam collapses --- so go early. ₹40-60 per serving.

There is nothing else like it anywhere. If you're in Delhi between December and February, eating daulat ki chaat is non-negotiable.

### Winter Food Walk Route

Start at **Paranthe Wali Gali** for stuffed parathas (₹50-80 each), then walk to **Natraj Dahi Bhalla** at the Chandni Chowk end for the city's best yoghurt-soaked lentil dumplings (₹80). Continue to **Old Famous Jalebi Wala** opposite Red Fort for hot jalebis dipped in sugar syrup (₹60 per plate). End near Jama Masjid at **Karim's** for kebabs and nihari.

A guided [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) covers 5-7 stops in 3 hours and costs ₹2,000-3,500 per person. In winter, the walking pace is comfortable and the food tastes better in cool air.

## Rooftop Dining

Winter evenings are made for rooftop restaurants. Temperatures drop to 10-15°C after sunset --- cool enough for a jacket, warm enough to sit outdoors with a heat lamp or blanket.

**Connaught Place rooftops:** Unplugged Courtyard and Lord of the Drinks both have terraces overlooking CP's circular market. Cocktails ₹500-800, dinner ₹1,500-2,500 per person. Walk from Rajiv Chowk metro (Blue/Yellow Line).

**Ek Bar (Defence Colony):** A speakeasy with a rooftop terrace. Creative cocktails --- smoked paan Old Fashioned, saffron gin sour --- ₹600-900 each. Small and intimate; go early on weekends.

**Olive Bar & Kitchen (Mehrauli):** Mediterranean food in a whitewashed courtyard near Qutub Minar. The winter setting is beautiful --- candles, fairy lights, olive trees. ₹3,000-4,000 per person with wine. Weeknight dinners are quieter.

## Republic Day --- January 26

India's Republic Day parade is one of the world's great military and cultural spectacles, held annually on **January 26** along Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath), from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.

**What you see:** Military regiments, tanks, missile launchers, cavalry on horseback, cultural floats from every Indian state, school children's performances, and a spectacular flypast by the Indian Air Force. The parade runs about 2.5 hours.

**Tickets:** Available through the government portal from early January. Covered stand seats cost ₹100-500. Apply early --- they sell out fast. Free standing areas along the route fill up from 6am. Arrive by 7am at the latest.

**Security:** Heavy. Expect road closures across central Delhi from January 24-26. Metro stations near the route (Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan) may have restricted access. Carry government-issued photo ID.

## Surajkund Mela --- February

An annual international crafts fair held in **Surajkund, Faridabad**, about 45 minutes from central Delhi. Running for two weeks in February, it brings together artisans from across India and partner countries, with folk performances, regional food stalls, and live craft demonstrations.

**Entry:** ₹120 on weekdays, ₹180 on weekends.
**Getting there:** Hire a cab or join a tour group. There's no direct metro connection, though shuttle buses run from select points during the mela.
**Time needed:** Half a day to a full day.

The food section is as much a draw as the crafts --- stalls from Rajasthan, Kerala, Northeast India, and the partner country (it rotates yearly) serve regional specialities. Budget ₹500-1,000 for food alone. For more on the event, see our [Surajkund Mela guide](/delhi/what-is-surajkund-mela/).

## Heritage Walks

Winter is prime season for Delhi's walking tours. The comfortable temperatures mean you can spend 2-3 hours on foot without fatigue.

**Nizamuddin Basti walk:** Explore the medieval neighbourhood around Nizamuddin Dargah --- Sufi shrines, Mughal-era tombs, and the house where poet Mirza Ghalib lived. Several operators run morning walks for ₹1,000-2,000 per person.

**Mehrauli heritage trail:** From Qutub Minar through the archaeological park, covering structures from the 12th to 19th centuries. Best with a guide who can decode the overlapping layers of history.

**Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi):** The walled city is best explored on foot in winter mornings. Narrow lanes, havelis with carved wooden balconies, spice markets, and rooftop views from Jama Masjid's minaret. Book a guided heritage walk for ₹1,500-3,000.

## What to Wear

Delhi winters catch many visitors off guard. Days are warm enough for a t-shirt, but mornings and evenings are cold --- especially in December and January.

**Layers are essential.** A light sweater or fleece for daytime, a proper jacket for evenings and early mornings. In January, temperatures can drop to 3-5°C at dawn.

**Scarf or shawl.** Useful for warmth and temple visits. Delhi's famous pashmina shawls are everywhere --- buy one at Dilli Haat (₹800-3,000 depending on quality) and use it for the rest of the trip.

**Closed shoes.** Trainers or ankle boots. Sandals are fine during midday but not for foggy mornings.

**Fog awareness.** Dense fog blankets Delhi on many December and January mornings, often not lifting until 10-11am. Flights are frequently delayed. If you have an early morning departure, check with your airline the night before. Build buffer time into morning plans.

## Best Winter Days

If you're choosing exact dates, here's the ranking:

1. **Late November (post-Diwali smog clearing):** Clear skies, 18-28°C, long days, uncrowded.
2. **Late January:** Republic Day parade, daulat ki chaat season, 12-22°C.
3. **Early February:** Surajkund Mela starts, warming weather, roses in bloom at Sunder Nursery.
4. **Mid-December:** Festive atmosphere, Christmas events in hotels, but fog starts building.
