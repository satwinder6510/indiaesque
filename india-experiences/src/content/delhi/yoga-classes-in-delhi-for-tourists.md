  - question: "Can tourists do drop-in yoga classes in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Most yoga studios in Delhi accept drop-in students without advance booking. Expect to pay ₹500-1,000 ($6-12) per class. The Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre in Kailash Colony, Yoga Kshema near Safdarjung, and several studios in Hauz Khas all welcome tourists. Bring your own mat or rent one for ₹50-100."
  - question: "What is the best yoga centre in Delhi for beginners?"
    answer: "Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre in Kailash Colony is the best for beginners. Their open classes follow a fixed 12-posture sequence that's the same worldwide, so you always know what's coming. Teachers give individual corrections, and the pace is slower than vinyasa or power yoga studios. Drop-in cost is ₹500."
  - question: "Are there outdoor yoga sessions in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes. Free and low-cost group yoga happens every morning in Lodhi Gardens, Nehru Park, and at India Gate. These are informal gatherings — usually a local instructor with 10-30 regulars — starting at 6am. Quality varies, but it's a genuine Delhi experience. Lodhi Gardens near Jor Bagh metro gate is the most popular spot."

**Drop-in yoga classes in Delhi cost ₹500-1,000 ($6-12) per session, and several well-established centres welcome tourists without requiring advance booking or monthly memberships.** The Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre, Yoga Kshema, and studios around Hauz Khas are the most accessible options.

Delhi is where modern Indian yoga culture meets its traditional roots. You'll find everything from classical Hatha and Iyengar studios to trendy vinyasa flow spaces with exposed brick and cold-pressed juice bars. For tourists, the question isn't whether yoga is available — it's which style and neighbourhood suit you.

## Best Yoga Centres for Tourists

### Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre — Kailash Colony

This is the go-to recommendation for most visitors. The Sivananda tradition follows a fixed 12-posture sequence that's taught the same way in their centres worldwide, so if you've been to a Sivananda class in London or New York, you know exactly what to expect.

**Location:** Kailash Colony, near Kailash Colony metro (Violet Line)
**Drop-in:** ₹500 ($6) per class
**Schedule:** Morning class 6:30-8:00am, evening class 6:00-7:30pm
**Style:** Classical Hatha — 12 asanas, pranayama, and short meditation
**Level:** All levels, excellent for beginners. Teachers adjust individually.

The centre also runs 2-week beginner courses if you're staying longer. The space is simple — no fancy studio, just a clean hall with mats. That's part of the appeal. It feels like yoga, not a gym.

### Yoga Kshema — Safdarjung

One of Delhi's oldest independent yoga schools, Yoga Kshema focuses on Iyengar-style yoga with heavy emphasis on alignment and props. This is the place if you want precise instruction and correction.

**Location:** Safdarjung Enclave, near Green Park metro (Yellow Line), 10-minute walk
**Drop-in:** ₹700 ($8.50) per class
**Schedule:** Morning 7:00-8:30am, evening 5:30-7:00pm
**Style:** Iyengar — alignment-focused with blocks, straps, and bolsters
**Level:** Mixed. Complete beginners may find the pace quick. Some experience helps.

### Studios in Hauz Khas

The [Hauz Khas area](/delhi/things-to-do-in-hauz-khas/) has become Delhi's wellness hub, with several modern yoga studios within walking distance of each other. These lean more towards the contemporary studio experience — clean changing rooms, filtered water, and booking apps.

**Studio Abhyas** — Hauz Khas Village. Vinyasa and Ashtanga. ₹800-1,000 per class. Morning and evening slots. Book via their app or walk in.

**Yoga Bliss** — Near Hauz Khas metro (Magenta/Yellow Line interchange). Hatha and restorative yoga. ₹600 per class. Quieter, smaller groups of 6-8 people. Good if you want more personal attention.

**The Yoga Studio HKV** — Power yoga and heated flow classes. ₹1,000 per class. This is the most fitness-oriented option. Popular with expats and young professionals.

## Free & Low-Cost Options

### Park Yoga

Every morning at sunrise, groups gather in Delhi's major parks for open-air yoga. It's free or donation-based, no booking required — just show up with a mat (or a towel) and join in.

**Lodhi Gardens** — The most popular. Look near the Jor Bagh metro gate entrance, usually starting 6:00-6:30am. Winter months (November-February) draw the biggest crowds. The [winter season](/delhi/things-to-do-in-delhi-in-winter/) is the best time for outdoor anything in Delhi.

**Nehru Park** — Chanakyapuri area, near Lok Kalyan Marg metro. 6am daily. A regular instructor leads sessions on the main lawn.

**India Gate Lawns** — Less structured. Small groups of 3-5 people do their own practice on the grass. More DIY than organised.

Quality varies. Some instructors are experienced; others are enthusiastic amateurs. Don't expect Sivananda-level instruction, but the experience of practising yoga in a Delhi park at sunrise — with parakeets overhead and joggers circling — is worth it regardless.

### Government-Run Centres

The **Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga** in South Delhi (near INA metro) offers classes for ₹100-200 per month. These are serious, traditional, and bureaucratic — you may need to register in person and bring passport copies. Worth it if you're staying for weeks, not practical for a few days.

## What To Bring

- **Your own mat** if you have one. Studio mats in Delhi range from fine to questionable.
- **Loose clothing.** Cotton is best for Delhi's climate.
- **Water bottle.** Studios provide filtered water but not always bottles.
- **Cash.** Many smaller studios and park instructors don't accept cards.
- **Mosquito repellent** for outdoor sessions, especially during monsoon and early winter.

## Best Time For Yoga In Delhi

Mornings are non-negotiable. By 10am in any month, Delhi is either too hot or too polluted (or both) for outdoor practice. Indoor studios work anytime, but the morning classes tend to be less crowded and more focused.

**October-March:** Best months overall. Cool mornings, clear skies (mostly), and outdoor yoga is at its peak. If you're visiting for yoga specifically, aim for this window.

**April-June:** Indoor studios only. Morning outdoor sessions are still possible at 6am, but 40°C+ days make afternoons unbearable.

**July-September:** Monsoon means humidity and mosquitoes. Indoor studios are fine. Outdoor sessions are cancelled when it rains.
