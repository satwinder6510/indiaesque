faq:
  - question: "How many days do you need in Delhi?"
    answer: "3 days is ideal to see the highlights — Old Delhi, major monuments, and South Delhi neighbourhoods. 2 days works if you're efficient. 4-5 days lets you explore deeper, take day trips to Agra, and enjoy the food scene without rushing."
  - question: "What is the best time to visit Delhi?"
    answer: "October to March offers the best weather — cool, dry, and comfortable for sightseeing. October-November and February-March are ideal. December-January can be cold (5-15°C) with fog. Avoid April-June (extreme heat, 40-45°C) and July-September (monsoon humidity)."
  - question: "Is 2 days enough for Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, but it's tight. Day 1: Old Delhi (Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk). Day 2: New Delhi (Humayun's Tomb, India Gate, Qutub Minar). You'll see the highlights but miss the neighbourhoods and food scene."
  - question: "What is the weather like in Delhi?"
    answer: "Delhi has extreme seasons. Winter (Dec-Feb): 5-20°C, foggy mornings. Summer (Apr-Jun): 35-45°C, intense heat. Monsoon (Jul-Sep): 25-35°C, humid with heavy rain. Autumn/Spring (Oct-Nov, Mar): 20-30°C, pleasant and ideal for visiting."
  - question: "What festivals happen in Delhi?"
    answer: "Diwali (Oct/Nov) lights up the city. Holi (March) brings colour celebrations. Republic Day (Jan 26) has a massive parade. Dussehra (Oct) features Ramlila performances. The Qutub Festival and Surajkund Mela happen in winter."

|----------|-----------------|
| 1 day | One area only — Old Delhi OR monuments |
| 2 days | Highlights: Old Delhi + major monuments |
| 3 days | Complete overview + food scene |
| 4-5 days | Deep exploration + Agra day trip |
| 1 week+ | Neighbourhoods, markets, day trips |

## Best Time to Visit

### October to March: Peak Season

This is when Delhi is at its best. Cool, dry weather makes walking around monuments comfortable.

- **October-November:** Ideal. 20-30°C, clear skies, Diwali festivities
- **December-January:** Cold mornings (5-15°C), fog delays flights, but daytime is pleasant
- **February-March:** Warming up, Holi celebrations, pre-summer sweet spot

### April to June: Avoid

Delhi becomes brutal. Temperatures hit 40-45°C daily. Heat waves are common. Even locals stay indoors midday. Monuments are empty but unbearable.

### July to September: Monsoon

Heavy rain, high humidity, mosquitoes. The city greens up and temperatures drop (25-35°C), but flooding disrupts transport. Not recommended for first-time visitors.
