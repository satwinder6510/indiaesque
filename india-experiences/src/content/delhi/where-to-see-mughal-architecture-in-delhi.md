  - question: "How many Mughal monuments are in Delhi?"
    answer: "Delhi has over 100 monuments from the Mughal period (1526-1857), though the exact count depends on how you define 'Mughal' versus earlier Sultanate-era buildings. The most significant are Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb (both UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Jama Masjid, Purana Qila, Safdarjung's Tomb, and the Nizamuddin complex. Many smaller tombs and mosques sit inside parks like Lodhi Gardens and Sunder Nursery."
  - question: "What is the most important Mughal building in Delhi?"
    answer: "Humayun's Tomb is architecturally the most important — built in 1570, it was the first garden tomb on the Indian subcontinent and the direct prototype for the Taj Mahal. Red Fort is historically the most significant as the seat of Mughal power from 1648 to 1857. Both are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. If you only see one, Humayun's Tomb is the better choice for its architecture and peaceful setting."
  - question: "Can you see Mughal architecture in Delhi in one day?"
    answer: "Yes. A focused one-day route covering Humayun's Tomb, Purana Qila, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid is achievable if you start by 8 AM. Add Safdarjung's Tomb and Nizamuddin Dargah if you have energy for a full 8-10 hour day. Hire a car with driver (₹1,500-2,500 for the day) to move efficiently between sites."

**Delhi contains over 100 monuments from the Mughal period (1526-1857), including two UNESCO World Heritage Sites — Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb — along with Jama Masjid (India's largest mosque), Purana Qila, Safdarjung's Tomb, and the Nizamuddin shrine complex.** No other city in India has this density of Mughal architecture, and you can see the empire's entire arc — from its ambitious beginnings to its final decline — within a 15-kilometre radius.

## A Brief History of Mughal Building in Delhi

The Mughals ruled the Indian subcontinent from 1526 to 1857, and Delhi was their capital for most of that period. Each emperor built on a massive scale, and their architectural style evolved dramatically over three centuries.

**Babur** (1526-1530) captured Delhi but didn't build much — he was still consolidating power. **Humayun** (1530-1556) lost and regained the throne; his tomb, built by his widow after his death, became the template for Mughal garden tombs. **Akbar** (1556-1605) built Purana Qila and shifted the capital to Agra and Fatehpur Sikri. **Shah Jahan** (1628-1658) moved the capital back to Delhi, built the Red Fort and Jama Masjid, and created the walled city of Shahjahanabad — what we now call Old Delhi.

After Shah Jahan, the empire weakened. **Aurangzeb** (1658-1707) was more interested in warfare than architecture. The later Mughals built smaller, less ambitious monuments. Safdarjung's Tomb (1754) is often called the last gasp of Mughal architecture — ornate but derivative, a copy of Humayun's Tomb without the original's clarity.

## The Major Mughal Monuments

### Humayun's Tomb (1570)

This is the starting point for understanding Mughal architecture in Delhi, and arguably the most rewarding single monument to visit. Commissioned by Humayun's senior widow, Hamida Banu Begum, and designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, it introduced the chaharbagh — the four-part garden divided by water channels — to India. This concept travelled directly from here to the Taj Mahal, built 70 years later.

The tomb sits on a raised platform in the centre of a 30-acre garden. The double dome (an outer dome for external proportions and an inner dome for the interior ceiling) was an engineering innovation that the Mughals repeated in every major building afterward. The red sandstone and white marble combination became the Mughal signature.

Inside the garden complex, you'll also find the tombs of Isa Khan (a noble who pre-dates the Mughals — his 1547 octagonal tomb is exquisite), Nila Gumbad, and the recently restored Bu Halima's Garden.

**Entry:** ₹600 ($7.50) for foreigners, ₹40 for Indians. **Hours:** Sunrise to sunset. **Best time:** Late afternoon (3:30-5:00 PM) when the light turns the sandstone golden. **Metro:** JLN Stadium (Violet Line), then a 10-minute auto-rickshaw ride.

For a detailed comparison with India's most famous monument, see our [Humayun's Tomb vs. Taj Mahal guide](/delhi/humayuns-tomb-vs-taj-mahal/).

### Red Fort (1648)

Shah Jahan built Lal Qila as the centrepiece of his new capital, Shahjahanabad. The fort's red sandstone walls stretch 2.5 kilometres in perimeter and rise 33 metres above the street. This was the seat of Mughal power for nearly 200 years and the place where India's independence was proclaimed on 15 August 1947. The Prime Minister still delivers the Independence Day address from its ramparts every year.

Inside, the most impressive structures are the **Diwan-i-Am** (Hall of Public Audience), the **Diwan-i-Khas** (Hall of Private Audience) with its famous inscription about paradise, and the **Rang Mahal** (Palace of Colours), which once had a ceiling of gold and silver. The British stripped most of the precious materials after the 1857 uprising, so what remains is a skeleton of the original splendour — but the scale and proportions are still imposing.

**Entry:** ₹600 ($7.50) for foreigners, ₹35 for Indians. The sound-and-light show (₹80) runs in the evening. **Hours:** 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM, closed Mondays. **Metro:** Chandni Chowk (Yellow Line) or Lal Qila (Violet Line).

### Jama Masjid (1656)

India's largest mosque, also built by Shah Jahan. The courtyard can hold 25,000 worshippers. Three gateways, four towers, and two 40-metre minarets frame a prayer hall with 260 pillars. The construction took 6 years and 5,000 workers.

Unlike Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb, Jama Masjid is not a museum — it's an active place of worship. Friday prayers draw thousands. Visitors are welcome outside prayer times, but dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered) and remove shoes before entering.

**Climb the southern minaret** (₹300 for foreigners, ₹20 for Indians) for the best panoramic view of Old Delhi — rooftops, satellite dishes, and the Red Fort walls in the distance. This is the best aerial photograph you'll get of the old city.

**Entry:** Free for the mosque. Minaret climb charged separately. **Hours:** Open outside prayer times; avoid 12:30-2:00 PM on Fridays. **Getting there:** Walk from Jama Masjid Metro (Violet Line).

### Purana Qila (1538)

The Old Fort predates most Mughal buildings in Delhi. Started by Humayun and completed by his rival Sher Shah Suri (who briefly ousted the Mughals), it sits on a mound believed to be the site of Indraprastha, the legendary city from the Mahabharata. Excavations have found pottery dating back 3,000 years.

The key structures are the **Qila-i-Kuhna Masjid** (1541), one of the finest pre-Mughal mosques in India with exquisite mihrab stonework, and the **Sher Mandal**, an octagonal tower that Humayun used as a library. It's also where Humayun died in 1556 — he tripped on the steep stairs while rushing to answer the call to prayer.

The fort grounds include a lake with boating (₹100 for 30 minutes) and a well-maintained park. It's less crowded than Red Fort and more atmospheric.

**Entry:** ₹300 ($3.75) for foreigners, ₹25 for Indians. **Hours:** 7 AM to 5 PM. **Metro:** Pragati Maidan (Blue Line).

### Safdarjung's Tomb (1754)

The last significant Mughal garden tomb in Delhi. Built for Safdarjung, the Nawab of Awadh and briefly the Mughal Prime Minister. The layout copies Humayun's Tomb — chaharbagh garden, central domed mausoleum on a platform — but the execution is more ornamental and less cohesive. Historians describe it as late Mughal decadence: lots of decorative plasterwork, less structural clarity.

That said, the gardens are beautiful, especially in winter when the flowerbeds are in bloom. The tomb is far less visited than Humayun's Tomb, which means you can photograph it without crowds.

**Entry:** ₹300 ($3.75) for foreigners, ₹25 for Indians. **Hours:** Sunrise to sunset. **Metro:** Safdarjung Tomb (Yellow Line) — the only Delhi monument with its own metro stop.

### Nizamuddin Dargah and Surrounding Monuments

The shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya (1325) predates the Mughals, but the Mughal-era additions and surrounding monuments make this area essential for understanding the period. The Mughals were devoted to the Sufi saint, and several nobles built their tombs in the adjacent neighbourhood.

**Chausath Khamba** (1623-1624) is a pavilion of 64 marble pillars with some of the finest jali (lattice) work in Delhi. Nearby, you'll find the tomb of Mughal princess Jahanara (Shah Jahan's daughter) and the grave of the Urdu poet Amir Khusrau.

**Thursday evening qawwali:** The weekly Sufi devotional music session at the dargah is one of Delhi's most powerful cultural experiences. Free, open to all faiths. Arrive by 7:00 PM.

**Entry:** Free. **Getting there:** Walk from JLN Stadium Metro (Violet Line) or Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station.

## Suggested One-Day Mughal Architecture Route

If you want to see the highlights in one day, here's a practical sequence:

1. **8:00 AM — Humayun's Tomb** (1.5-2 hours). Start here when it's cool and uncrowded.
2. **10:30 AM — Purana Qila** (1 hour). A 10-minute drive from Humayun's Tomb.
3. **12:00 PM — Lunch.** Eat near India Gate or in Khan Market.
4. **1:30 PM — Red Fort** (1.5-2 hours). Enter through Lahore Gate.
5. **3:30 PM — Jama Masjid** (45 minutes). Walk from Red Fort — it's 500 metres.
6. **5:00 PM — Safdarjung's Tomb** (45 minutes). Drive from Old Delhi, 30-40 minutes depending on traffic.

**Total cost for entries:** Approximately ₹1,800 ($22) for foreign visitors. **Transport:** Hire a car with driver for the day — ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) — which is more efficient than metro-hopping between sites with entry queues.
