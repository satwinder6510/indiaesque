Delhi is a palimpsest of empires. Seven cities have risen and fallen here over 2,500 years, each leaving monuments that still stand. Here's what to see and the history behind it.

## UNESCO World Heritage Sites

### Humayun's Tomb

**Built:** 1570 | **Entry:** ₹550 (foreigners) | **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours

The tomb of Mughal Emperor Humayun, commissioned by his widow. This garden tomb is considered the architectural prototype for the Taj Mahal — note the symmetry, the charbagh garden, and the white marble dome on red sandstone.

**What to See:**
- Main tomb with stunning geometric patterns
- Isa Khan's Tomb (earlier, more intimate)
- Arab Serai gateway
- Nila Gumbad (blue dome)
- Charbagh garden layout

**Tips:** Go early morning for best light and fewer crowds. Walk the full garden for context. Combine with Nizamuddin Dargah (10-minute walk).

### Qutub Minar Complex

**Built:** 1193-1368 | **Entry:** ₹550 (foreigners) | **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours

A 73-metre tower marking the beginning of Muslim rule in India. The surrounding complex is one of Delhi's most atmospheric heritage sites.

**What to See:**
- **Qutub Minar** — five-storey victory tower with intricate carvings
- **Iron Pillar** — 1,600+ years old, famously rust-resistant
- **Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque** — first mosque in Delhi, built with temple materials
- **Alai Darwaza** — stunning gateway with calligraphy
- **Alai Minar** — unfinished tower stump
- **Iltutmish's Tomb**

**Tips:** Sunset light is magical but crowded. Morning is better for photos. The complex is large — don't rush.

### Red Fort (Lal Qila)

**Built:** 1639-1648 | **Entry:** ₹550 (foreigners) | **Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours

The seat of Mughal power for 200 years. Shah Jahan built this as his palace when he moved the capital from Agra. The massive red sandstone walls stretch 2 km.

**What to See:**
- **Lahori Gate** — main entrance
- **Chhatta Chowk** — covered bazaar (now sells souvenirs)
- **Diwan-i-Am** — public audience hall
- **Diwan-i-Khas** — private audience hall with famous inscription: "If there be Paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this"
- **Museums** — freedom struggle and archaeology

**Tips:** Sound and light show in evenings (skip it — underwhelming). Go early to beat tour groups. The fort is massive — allow proper time.

## Other Major Monuments

### Jama Masjid

**Built:** 1656 | **Entry:** Free (₹300 camera fee) | **Time needed:** 45 min - 1 hour

India's largest mosque, built by Shah Jahan. The courtyard holds 25,000 worshippers. Climb the minaret for panoramic Old Delhi views.

**Tips:** Dress modestly (robes available for rent). Remove shoes. Non-Muslims cannot enter during prayer times. Friday noon is the main weekly prayer — avoid unless you want to see it.

### Lodhi Gardens

**Built:** 15th-16th century | **Entry:** Free | **Time needed:** 1-2 hours

A green oasis containing tombs of the Lodhi dynasty. Popular with joggers, couples, and families. The tombs are scattered across landscaped lawns.

**Tips:** Best at sunrise or sunset. Bring water. Combine with nearby Khan Market.

### India Gate

**Built:** 1931 | **Entry:** Free | **Time needed:** 30 minutes

A war memorial arch honouring soldiers who died in WWI and the Afghan wars. Now a popular evening hangout. The eternal flame (Amar Jawan Jyoti) was merged with the National War Memorial nearby.

**Tips:** Visit at sunset when it's illuminated. Avoid weekends (extremely crowded). The surrounding Rajpath/Kartavya Path area is pleasant for a walk.

### Agrasen ki Baoli

**Built:** 14th century | **Entry:** Free | **Time needed:** 30 minutes

A stepped well with 103 steps descending into the earth. An atmospheric spot — the symmetry and depth are striking. Featured in the film PK.

**Tips:** Not crowded. Combine with Connaught Place (10-minute walk). Best photographed midday when light enters.

### Mehrauli Archaeological Park

**Entry:** Free | **Time needed:** 1-2 hours

An open-air museum of ruins from 1,000+ years of history — Rajput, Sultanate, Mughal, and British. Over 100 monuments scattered across the forest. Delhi's best-kept heritage secret.

**What to See:**
- Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb
- Rajon ki Baoli (stepped well)
- Balban's Tomb
- Metcalfe's Folly

**Tips:** Bring water, wear good shoes. Less crowded than Qutub Minar (which is adjacent). Hire a local guide for context.

## The Seven Cities of Delhi

Delhi has been capital to many empires, each building their own city:

1. **Qila Rai Pithora** (1180s) — last Hindu rulers
2. **Siri** (1303) — Alauddin Khilji's citadel
3. **Tughlaqabad** (1321) — abandoned fortress city
4. **Jahanpanah** (1326-1351) — Muhammad bin Tughlaq
5. **Firozabad** (1354) — Firoz Shah Kotla ruins

7. **Shahjahanabad** (1639) — Old Delhi, still inhabited

Modern **New Delhi** (1911-1931) is sometimes called the eighth city.

## Heritage Walks

The best way to understand Delhi's layered history is with a guided walk.

Most walks cover Old Delhi, Nizamuddin, or Mehrauli. ₹500-1,500 per person.
