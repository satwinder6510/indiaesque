faq:
  - question: "Can I get by with English in Delhi?"
    answer: "Yes, in most tourist areas. Hotel staff, restaurant servers, museum guides, Metro announcements, and Uber/Ola drivers generally understand enough English for basic communication. Connaught Place, Khan Market, South Delhi, and the airport are especially English-friendly. You'll hit more language barriers in Old Delhi's markets, outer suburbs, and with auto rickshaw drivers."
  - question: "What Hindi words should I learn for visiting Delhi?"
    answer: "A few key phrases help enormously. 'Namaste' (hello), 'Dhanyavaad' (thank you), 'Kitna?' (how much?), 'Bahut mehenga' (too expensive), 'Haan' (yes), 'Nahi' (no), and 'Bhaiya' (brother — used to address male shopkeepers and drivers). Even basic attempts at Hindi earn goodwill and better prices in markets."
  - question: "Are signs in Delhi written in English?"
    answer: "Most official signs are bilingual — Hindi and English. Metro stations, road signs, museum labels, and government buildings all have English text. Restaurant menus in tourist areas are in English. Market signs in Old Delhi and local neighbourhoods are more likely to be Hindi-only, though Google Translate's camera feature handles Hindi script reasonably well."

**Hindi is Delhi's primary language, spoken by the vast majority of the city's 20+ million residents.** English is widely understood in tourist areas, hotels, restaurants, and by educated professionals — you can get through an entire Delhi trip speaking only English if you stick to the main tourist circuit.

That said, knowing a handful of Hindi words changes the dynamic of your interactions. Shopkeepers give you better prices, auto drivers are more cooperative, and street food vendors grin when you order in Hindi. You don't need fluency — just five or six phrases go a long way.

## Hindi: The Main Language

Hindi is the language of daily life in Delhi. It's what you'll hear on the streets, in markets, on the radio, and in most conversations around you. Delhi Hindi is informal and peppered with Urdu vocabulary and Punjabi slang — a reflection of the city's mixed migration history.

The Hindi spoken in Delhi differs from textbook Hindi. It's faster, full of contractions, and blends English words into sentences naturally. You'll hear people switch between Hindi and English mid-sentence — this mix is so common it has its own name: "Hinglish."

## Where English Works

**Hotels:** All staff at mid-range and upscale hotels speak functional English. Budget guesthouses in areas like Paharganj usually have at least one English-speaking person at reception.

**Restaurants:** English menus are standard at any restaurant where a meal costs ₹300+ per person. Waitstaff in Connaught Place, Khan Market, Hauz Khas, and Defence Colony speak English. Street food stalls in Old Delhi — not so much, but pointing works perfectly.

**Transport:** Delhi Metro announcements are in Hindi and English. Metro signage is bilingual. Uber and Ola drivers communicate through the app's GPS, so language is rarely an issue. Auto rickshaw drivers usually speak limited English — knowing your destination in Hindi helps. Read our [transport guide](/delhi/how-to-get-around-delhi/) for more.

**Museums and monuments:** Most have English signage and English-speaking guides. Audio guides at places like Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb are available in English.

**Shopping:** Shopkeepers in tourist markets (Janpath, Dilli Haat, Khan Market) speak English. In wholesale markets like Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, or Lajpat Nagar, English is less common — but numbers are universal, and most vendors can quote prices in English.

## Where You'll Hit Language Barriers

**Old Delhi's inner lanes.** Once you're deep inside the bazaars of Chandni Chowk or Chawri Bazaar, English drops off sharply. The people running century-old spice shops or fabric stalls speak Hindi and Urdu primarily. Having Google Translate handy or a local guide makes a huge difference. Our [scams guide](/delhi/how-to-avoid-scams-in-delhi/) covers communication tips for tourist areas.

**Outer suburbs.** Areas beyond the tourist map — East Delhi, North Delhi, parts of Dwarka — have less English exposure. You're unlikely to visit these areas, but if you do, basic Hindi phrases are essential.

**Government offices and hospitals.** Staff at government counters (visa offices, police stations) may speak limited English. Higher-ranking officials usually do.

## Other Languages You'll Hear

**Punjabi** is Delhi's second most common language. The city absorbed millions of Punjabi-speaking refugees during Partition in 1947, and their descendants make up a significant chunk of Delhi's population. Areas like Karol Bagh, Rajouri Garden, and Punjabi Bagh are dominated by Punjabi speakers. You'll hear it in markets, taxis, and family conversations.

**Urdu** is linguistically very close to Hindi — the spoken versions are nearly identical. Written Urdu uses a different script (Nastaliq, related to Arabic). You'll hear Urdu primarily in Muslim-majority areas like Old Delhi, Nizamuddin, and Jamia Nagar. If you speak Hindi, you understand Urdu, and vice versa.

**Bhojpuri, Maithili, and other languages** are spoken by migrant communities from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and other states. Delhi draws workers from across India, so you'll hear dozens of languages in the background, though Hindi remains the common language everyone defaults to.

## Useful Hindi Phrases

| English | Hindi | Pronunciation |
|---|---|---|
| Hello | Namaste | na-MAS-tay |
| Thank you | Dhanyavaad | DUN-ya-vaad |
| How much? | Kitna? | KIT-na? |
| Too expensive | Bahut mehenga | ba-HOOT meh-HEN-ga |
| Yes | Haan | HAAN |
| No | Nahi | na-HEE |
| Water | Paani | PAA-nee |
| Brother (to address men) | Bhaiya | BHY-ya |
| Sister (to address women) | Didi | DEE-dee |
| Where is...? | ...kahaan hai? | ka-HAAN hai? |
| I don't understand | Samajh nahi aaya | SA-majh na-HEE AA-ya |

Using "bhaiya" and "didi" when talking to shopkeepers and service staff is a Delhi-specific habit that immediately signals you're not a complete outsider. It's the equivalent of "mate" in Australian English — friendly, informal, and expected.
