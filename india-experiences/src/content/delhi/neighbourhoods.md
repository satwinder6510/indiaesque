faq:
  - question: "What are the best neighbourhoods to visit in Delhi?"
    answer: "Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk) for history and street food. Connaught Place for shopping and restaurants. Hauz Khas for nightlife and cafes. Khan Market for upscale shopping. Nizamuddin for Sufi heritage. Each offers a different slice of Delhi."
  - question: "Is Paharganj worth staying in?"
    answer: "Only if you're on a tight budget. Paharganj has cheap hostels and hotels, but the area is noisy, chaotic, and gets rough after dark. Better budget options exist in Karol Bagh or South Delhi hostels like Zostel and Madpackers."
  - question: "What is there to do in Connaught Place?"
    answer: "Shopping at branded stores and Janpath market, restaurants and cafes in the inner circle, nightlife in the outer blocks (N and M), and access to Palika Bazaar underground. Rajiv Chowk metro station is right underneath. It's Delhi's commercial heart."
  - question: "What is Hauz Khas Village known for?"
    answer: "Hauz Khas Village has Delhi's densest concentration of cafes, bars, boutiques, and art galleries, all in converted old buildings around a medieval water tank and ruins. Best visited in the evening. The adjacent Deer Park is great for a morning walk."
