**The Airport Express Metro is the fastest and cheapest option — ₹60 ($0.72) and 20 minutes to New Delhi station.** Uber and Ola cost ₹300-500 depending on traffic and take 30-60 minutes. Prepaid taxis run ₹400-600. Here's how each option works so you can pick the right one for your situation.

## Option 1: Airport Express Metro (Recommended)

The Orange Line Airport Express connects Indira Gandhi International Airport directly to **New Delhi metro station** (which links to the Yellow and Blue lines at Rajiv Chowk). This is the fastest route into the city, completely immune to Delhi's traffic.

**How to find it:** From Terminal 3 arrivals, follow signs for "Metro" or "Airport Express Line." It's a 5-minute walk through a covered corridor. Terminal 1 also has metro access via a shuttle bus (free, runs every 20 minutes).

**Fare:** ₹60 ($0.72) to New Delhi station. Buy a token at the counter or use a contactless card.

**Schedule:** Trains run from approximately 4:45 AM to 11:30 PM, every 10-15 minutes. The journey takes 20 minutes with stops at Dhaula Kuan, Delhi Aerocity, and Shivaji Stadium.

**From New Delhi station:** Switch to the Yellow Line (north to Chandni Chowk for Old Delhi, south to Hauz Khas for South Delhi) or the Blue Line (west to Karol Bagh, east to Pragati Maidan). Read our [Delhi Metro guide](/delhi/how-to-use-delhi-metro/) for route planning.

**Best for:** Anyone arriving between 5 AM and 10:30 PM who's heading to central Delhi, CP, or anywhere on the Yellow/Blue lines. Especially good during rush hours (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM) when road traffic is gridlocked.

**Not ideal for:** Travellers with heavy luggage (there are no porters and you'll navigate stairs and escalators), late-night arrivals, or those heading directly to South Delhi locations far from a metro station.

## Option 2: Uber or Ola

Both apps work from Delhi airport. The pickup point is at the **designated cab area** outside the arrivals hall — follow signs for "App-Based Cabs."

**Fares to common destinations:**
- Connaught Place: ₹300-500 ($3.60-6)
- Karol Bagh: ₹250-450 ($3-5.40)
- South Delhi (GK/Defence Colony): ₹250-400 ($3-4.80)
- Paharganj/New Delhi Station: ₹300-500 ($3.60-6)
- Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk): ₹350-550 ($4.20-6.60)

**Travel time:** 30-45 minutes without traffic, 60-90 minutes during rush hours. Late night (11 PM - 5 AM) is the fastest — 25-35 minutes to CP.

**Important:** You need an Indian SIM card with a working number for OTP (one-time password) verification when booking. Get a [SIM card at the airport](/delhi/best-sim-card-for-tourists-in-delhi/) first. Airtel and Jio counters are in the Terminal 3 arrivals hall. If your SIM isn't activated yet, use the prepaid taxi counter instead.

**Best for:** Groups (split the fare), travellers with lots of luggage, late-night arrivals, anyone going directly to a specific hotel.

## Option 3: Prepaid Taxi

The **Delhi Traffic Police Prepaid Taxi Counter** is inside the arrivals hall, before you exit to the main area. You pay a fixed fare at the counter, get a receipt, and hand it to the driver at the taxi stand outside. This eliminates haggling.

**Fares:**
- Connaught Place: ₹400-500 ($4.80-6)
- Karol Bagh: ₹350-450 ($4.20-5.40)
- South Delhi: ₹400-550 ($4.80-6.60)
- Paharganj: ₹350-450 ($4.20-5.40)

There's a 25% surcharge between 11 PM and 5 AM.

**How it works:** Pay at the counter, get a receipt showing destination and fare. Walk to the taxi stand. A coordinator assigns you a car. Hand the receipt to the driver at your destination — you've already paid. Tip ₹50-100 if they handle luggage.

**Best for:** Anyone without an Indian SIM card, first-time visitors who want a simple door-to-door option, late arrivals when the metro is closed.

**Watch out for:** Drivers sometimes claim the prepaid fare doesn't cover your exact destination and ask for extra money. It does. Show them the receipt and be firm. Also ignore anyone inside the terminal who approaches you offering taxi services — use only the official counter.

## What to Do Immediately at the Airport

1. **Get a SIM card.** Head to the Airtel or Jio counter in Terminal 3 arrivals. Cost is ₹500-700 ($6-8.40) for a tourist plan with data and calls. You need your passport. Activation can take 15-60 minutes — some activate instantly via eKYC.

2. **Withdraw cash.** ATMs are in the arrivals hall. HDFC and ICICI ATMs accept international cards reliably. Withdraw ₹5,000-10,000 ($60-120) to cover initial expenses — many street vendors and autos don't take cards.

3. **Pick your transport.** If it's between 5 AM and 10:30 PM and your SIM isn't active yet, take the metro. If it's late at night, use the prepaid taxi. If your SIM is working, book an [Uber or Ola](/delhi/is-uber-available-in-delhi/).

## What NOT to Do

**Don't take an unmetered taxi from the arrivals exit.** Drivers outside the terminal who approach you directly are unlicensed or charge 3-5x the normal rate. Walk past them.

**Don't exchange currency at the airport counters.** The rates are terrible. Use ATMs instead, or wait until you reach your hotel or a Thomas Cook office in CP.

**Don't book a hotel through anyone at the airport claiming your booking was cancelled.** This is an old scam. Your booking is fine. Call the hotel directly if you're worried.
