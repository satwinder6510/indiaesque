Delhi has 174 monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Most visitors see three or four of these — Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, maybe Jama Masjid — and call it done. But the real depth of Delhi's heritage sits in the dozens of tombs, mosques, step-wells, and fortress ruins scattered through parks, residential colonies, and even traffic roundabouts.

A heritage walk connects these sites into a story. Whether you hire a guide or follow a route on your phone, walking is how Delhi's history makes sense — you see how the Tughlaqs built on top of the Khiljis, and how the Mughals built on top of everyone.

This guide covers the four main heritage walk circuits in Delhi, the difference between guided and self-guided options, prices, and practical tips. For a broader trip overview, see the [Delhi city guide](/delhi/).

## The Four Main Heritage Walk Circuits

### 1. Old Delhi: The Mughal Circuit

**Route:** Chandni Chowk Metro → Chandni Chowk (street) → Sis Ganj Gurudwara → Kinari Bazaar → Jama Masjid → Matia Mahal lanes → Red Fort

**Distance:** 3-4 km | **Duration:** 3-4 hours | **Best time:** Early morning (7:00-8:00am start to beat crowds)

This is the walk most people picture when they think of Delhi heritage. Old Delhi — officially Shahjahanabad — was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan starting in 1639. The same Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal in Agra designed this walled city as his new capital, moving the seat of Mughal power from Agra to Delhi.

You start at Chandni Chowk, once the widest and grandest avenue in Asia. It's narrower now, with electrical cables and signboards crowding the sightlines, but the bones of the Mughal city are still visible if you look up past the shop fronts. The street runs dead straight from the Red Fort gates to Fatehpuri Masjid, about 1.5 km west.

Along the way, you pass through some of the oldest continuously operating markets in the world. Dariba Kalan has been selling silver and jewellery since the 17th century. Kinari Bazaar sells wedding trimmings — tinsel, ribbons, sequined fabrics. The spice market at Khari Baoli, one block north, is the largest in Asia.

Jama Masjid, halfway through the walk, is India's largest mosque. Shah Jahan commissioned it in 1644, and it took 6 years and 5,000 workers to complete. The courtyard holds 25,000 people. Climb the southern minaret (₹300 for foreigners, ₹20 for Indians) for the best aerial view of Old Delhi — rooftop after rooftop stretching to the Red Fort's sandstone walls.

The Red Fort is the endpoint. Whether you go inside depends on your interest level — the museums and sound-and-light show are decent but not essential. The exterior walls and the Lahore Gate are impressive from outside. Read our guide on [whether Red Fort is worth visiting](/delhi/is-red-fort-worth-visiting/) for a full breakdown.

**Combine with:** This walk pairs naturally with an [Old Delhi food tour](/delhi/food-tours/). Do the heritage walk first (7:00-10:00am), then eat your way back through the same lanes.

### 2. Mehrauli: The Qutub Circuit

**Route:** Qutub Minar Metro → Qutub Minar Complex → Mehrauli Archaeological Park → Jamali Kamali Mosque → Rajon ki Baoli → Balban's Tomb → Madhi Masjid

**Distance:** 3-5 km | **Duration:** 3-4 hours | **Best time:** Morning (the park gets hot after 11am)

Mehrauli is where Delhi's history begins. This is the site of Lal Kot, the first of the [seven cities of Delhi](/delhi/what-are-the-7-cities-of-delhi/), built by the Tomar Rajputs in the 8th century. When Qutb-ud-din Aibak defeated the last Hindu ruler in 1192, he built the Qutub Minar and Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque using pillars plundered from 27 Hindu and Jain temples. The recycled carvings are still visible on the mosque's columns — Hindu gods and Jain tirthankaras sit right next to Arabic inscriptions.

The Qutub Minar complex is the main draw and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The 73-metre sandstone tower took three successive rulers to complete, each adding their own style. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard dates to the 4th century Gupta period — 1,600 years old and barely rusted, which metallurgists still study.

But the real discovery is [Mehrauli Archaeological Park](/delhi/what-is-mehrauli-archaeological-park/), just south of the Qutub complex. This sprawling parkland contains over 100 monuments from the 11th to the 19th century, most of them unmarked and unvisited. You'll find Balban's Tomb — the earliest known example of a true arch in Indian architecture — sitting quietly in the trees with no queue, no ticket counter, and sometimes no other visitors.

Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb, inside the park, has some of the finest tile work and painted ceilings in Delhi. It's locked, but the chowkidar (caretaker) will open it for you — a small tip (₹50-100) is customary.

Rajon ki Baoli is a step-well three storeys deep, partially overgrown with trees, and far more atmospheric than the famous Agrasen ki Baoli in central Delhi. You can walk down the steps and sit on the lowest platform where the water once stood.

**Entry fees:** Qutub Minar complex — ₹600 ($7.50) for foreigners, ₹40 for Indians. Mehrauli Archaeological Park — free.

### 3. Lodhi / New Delhi: The Tomb Circuit

**Route:** Humayun's Tomb → Sunder Nursery → Isa Khan's Tomb → Nizamuddin Basti (optional) → Lodhi Gardens → Safdarjung's Tomb

**Distance:** 4-5 km | **Duration:** 3-5 hours | **Best time:** Late afternoon (the light on Humayun's Tomb at 4:00pm is the best in Delhi)

This circuit covers Delhi's most refined Mughal architecture. Humayun's Tomb, the centrepiece, was built in 1570 by Humayun's widow Hamida Banu Begum. It was the first garden tomb on the Indian subcontinent and the direct prototype for the Taj Mahal, built 70 years later. The resemblance is unmistakable — the same symmetry, the same chaharbagh (four-part garden), the same white marble dome on red sandstone. Read our [Humayun's Tomb vs Taj Mahal comparison](/delhi/humayuns-tomb-vs-taj-mahal/) for more.

Sunder Nursery, the restored gardens adjacent to Humayun's Tomb, opened to the public in 2018 after a 16-year restoration led by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. It contains 15 heritage monuments, including the Sunderwala Burj and Lakkarwala Burj, surrounded by manicured lawns, flowering trees, and a lotus pond. Entry is ₹20 — it's one of the best deals in Delhi.

From Sunder Nursery, walk or rickshaw to Lodhi Gardens, a 90-acre park containing tombs of the Sayyid and Lodhi dynasties (15th-16th century). Bara Gumbad and Sheesh Gumbad are the standouts. The park is also where Delhi's runners, yoga practitioners, and morning walkers congregate — it's a social space as much as a historical one. No entry fee, open sunrise to sunset.

Safdarjung's Tomb at the southern end of Lodhi Road is often called the last flicker of Mughal architecture. Built in 1754, it's ornate but a bit tired compared to Humayun's Tomb — the empire was declining and so was the craftsmanship. Still worth a stop if you're walking the full circuit. Entry: ₹300 ($3.75) for foreigners, ₹25 for Indians.

### 4. Nizamuddin: The Sufi Circuit

**Route:** Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah → Chausath Khamba → Atgah Khan's Tomb → Mirza Ghalib's Tomb → Humayun's Tomb (connects to Circuit 3)

**Distance:** 2-3 km | **Duration:** 2-3 hours | **Best time:** Thursday evening for qawwali (arrive by 7:00pm)

Nizamuddin Basti is a 700-year-old neighbourhood that grew around the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, one of India's most revered Sufi saints. The dargah is still an active place of worship — people come daily to pray, tie threads to the marble lattice screens, and leave offerings of rose petals and chadars (cloth coverings).

The surrounding lanes contain several significant tombs and monuments. Chausath Khamba (64 Pillars) is a 17th-century marble hall with an interlocking lattice ceiling — one of the finest examples of marble jali work in Delhi. Mirza Ghalib, the greatest Urdu poet, is buried in a simple grave nearby.

This circuit connects directly to Humayun's Tomb (a 10-minute walk), so you can combine it with the Lodhi circuit for a full-day heritage experience.

The best time to visit Nizamuddin is Thursday evening for the qawwali — Sufi devotional music performed live at the dargah after the evening prayers. It's free, open to all faiths, and one of the most powerful cultural experiences in Delhi. Get there by 7:00pm for a good position. Women are welcome but should dress conservatively and cover their heads.

## Guided vs Self-Guided Walks

**Guided walks** cost ₹500-2,500 ($6-30) per person depending on group size, guide expertise, and duration. The best guides are trained by INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) or are certified by the Delhi government's tourism department. They bring the stones to life — explaining who built what, why, and what political drama was happening at the time.

INTACH runs weekend heritage walks on a regular schedule, typically ₹500-800 per person for 2-3 hours. They announce walks on their social media pages and website. These are among the best-value guided experiences in Delhi.

Private guides charge ₹2,000-5,000 ($25-60) for a half-day walk. If you're splitting between 2-4 people, this is reasonable and gives you the flexibility to go at your own speed.

**Self-guided walks** are completely free (aside from entry fees). Old Delhi, Lodhi Gardens, and Mehrauli Archaeological Park all have enough signage and Google Maps coverage to navigate independently. Download offline maps before you go — phone signal drops inside some monuments.

For Old Delhi, our [self-guided walking tour](/delhi/self-guided-walking-tour-old-delhi/) gives you a step-by-step route with landmarks, turns, and food stops marked.

## Practical Tips

**Footwear:** You'll walk 3-5 km on mixed surfaces — paved roads, gravel paths, and uneven stone floors inside monuments. Comfortable walking shoes or sturdy sandals work. You'll need to remove shoes at mosques and dargahs — slip-on shoes save time.

**Water:** Carry at least 1 litre. There are few water vendors inside archaeological parks. From March to September, carry 2 litres.

**Timing:** Start early. Old Delhi is best before 9:00am, when the lanes are quiet enough to hear your guide. Mehrauli and Lodhi Gardens are best before 11:00am or after 3:00pm to avoid peak heat (October-March excluded — those months are comfortable all day).

**Photography:** Photography is allowed at all ASI monuments. Tripods may require an additional fee (₹25-50). Drone photography is banned at all protected monuments. Flash photography is prohibited inside Humayun's Tomb and some enclosed spaces.

**Entry tickets:** Buy tickets at the monument counters or online through the ASI website. Some monuments now accept UPI payments at the counter. Keep your ticket — guards may check it at multiple points inside larger complexes.

**Dress code:** Mosques and dargahs require modest clothing — shoulders and knees covered. Women should carry a scarf to cover their head at religious sites. This applies to Jama Masjid, Nizamuddin Dargah, and smaller mosques along the routes.

**Guides at monument gates:** Men will approach you at Red Fort, Qutub Minar, and Humayun's Tomb offering guide services. Some are knowledgeable, many are not. If you want a guide, negotiate the price upfront (₹200-500 is fair for 45 minutes) and ask what language they speak. Better yet, book a proper guide in advance.
