  - question: "How long should I spend in Delhi?"
    answer: "Most travellers should plan 3 days for Delhi. This covers Old Delhi's Mughal heritage, New Delhi's monuments and gardens, and at least one deeper experience like a food tour or heritage walk. Two days works if you're short on time but feels rushed. Four to five days lets you explore neighbourhoods, take day trips, and eat at a more relaxed pace."
  - question: "Is Delhi worth more than 2 days?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Two days covers the highlights — Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, India Gate. But Delhi's real character lives in its food lanes, local markets, and neighbourhood streets. A third day lets you experience Hauz Khas, Nizamuddin, or Old Delhi's food culture properly rather than just photographing monuments."
  - question: "Can I see Delhi in 1 day?"
    answer: "You can see the top 5-6 sights in one very full day starting at Red Fort and ending at Connaught Place. But you'll spend more time in transit than at any single location, and you won't have time for food experiences or neighbourhood exploration. One day gives you a snapshot, not a real visit."

**Most travellers need 3 days to see Delhi properly, though 2 days covers the main highlights and 4-5 days lets you go significantly deeper.** The right number depends on whether you want a monument tour or a full-city experience.

Delhi is not a city you "complete." People who've lived here for decades still discover new lanes and old restaurants. But here's a realistic breakdown of what each timeframe gets you.

## 1 Day: The Speed Run

One day in Delhi means picking the five or six most important stops and connecting them by metro and auto-rickshaw. A realistic single day covers:

- **Red Fort** and a quick walk through **Chandni Chowk** (morning)
- **Jama Masjid** and street food lunch in Old Delhi
- **Humayun's Tomb** (early afternoon)
- **India Gate** and **Connaught Place** (evening)

What you miss: Qutub Minar, Lodhi Gardens, all of South Delhi, any food tour or heritage walk, and the rhythm of the city. One day is a sampler plate. You'll know what Delhi looks like, but not what it feels like.

## 2 Days: The Highlights

Two days is the minimum for anyone who actually wants to engage with Delhi beyond monuments. You add:

- **Qutub Minar** and the Mehrauli archaeological area
- **Lodhi Gardens** for a proper walk
- More time in **Chandni Chowk** to explore side lanes
- A sit-down dinner at one of Delhi's great restaurants
- **Khan Market** or **Hauz Khas Village** for shopping

Two days works well if Delhi is a stopover on a longer India trip — most people heading to Rajasthan, Agra, or Varanasi pass through Delhi. You'll cover the big-name sights and get at least a taste of the food.

The trade-off: no day trips, no deep food experiences, and you'll feel like you're always moving. Read our [2-day Delhi guide](/delhi/is-2-days-enough-for-delhi/) for a detailed itinerary.

## 3 Days: The Sweet Spot

This is what we recommend for most visitors. Three days gives you everything from the 2-day plan plus room for the experiences that actually make Delhi memorable:

- A guided [food tour](/delhi/food-tours/) through Old Delhi (half day)
- **Nizamuddin Dargah** for Thursday evening qawwali
- **Hauz Khas** for lake ruins, cafes, and boutique shopping
- **Agrasen Ki Baoli** stepwell
- A cooking class learning butter chicken or biryani
- A proper [heritage walk](/delhi/heritage-walks/) through one of Delhi's historical layers
- Time to get lost in a neighbourhood without checking Google Maps

Three days lets you balance the must-see list with personal discovery. You eat better because you're not rushing between sites at mealtimes. You can sit in Lodhi Gardens for an hour and watch parakeets instead of racing to the next monument.

Our [3-day itinerary](/delhi/how-to-spend-3-days-in-delhi/) has a detailed day-by-day plan.

## 4-5 Days: Going Deeper

Four or five days is for travellers who want to understand Delhi, not just visit it. You can now add:

### Day Trips
- **Agra and the Taj Mahal**: Take the Gatimaan Express from Hazrat Nizamuddin station (6:50 AM departure, arrives 8:30 AM). Full [day trip guide here](/delhi/day-trips/).
- **Neemrana Fort Palace**: A 15th-century fort converted into a heritage hotel, 2 hours from Delhi on the Jaipur highway. Great for a one-night getaway or full-day visit.

### Neighbourhood Deep Dives
- **Mehrauli**: The oldest continuously inhabited area of Delhi. The Qutub complex is just the start — the surrounding archaeological park has over 100 ruins from 1,000 years of history.
- **Nizamuddin**: The Sufi quarter, with the dargah, Humayun's Tomb, and Sunder Nursery all within walking distance.
- **Lodhi Colony**: Delhi's street art district, where entire building facades have been painted by international artists.

### Specialised Experiences
- A full-day food crawl covering breakfast in Old Delhi, lunch in Karol Bagh, and dinner in South Delhi
- **National Crafts Museum** near Pragati Maidan — one of India's best folk art collections, with live artisan demonstrations
- An evening pub crawl in Hauz Khas or Connaught Place
- **Dilli Haat** for handicrafts from every Indian state under one roof (₹30 entry)

### Museums and Galleries
- **National Museum** on Janpath (half day minimum for the Indus Valley and Mughal galleries)
- **Partition Museum** at Red Fort — a recent addition documenting the 1947 division
- **Kiran Nadar Museum of Art** in Saket for contemporary Indian art

## What Determines Your Ideal Length?

**If Delhi is your first stop in India**: Plan 3 days. You'll need a day to adjust to the pace, the noise, and the traffic. Delhi is an intense introduction, and rushing through it while jet-lagged is a recipe for overwhelm.

**If you've been in India for a while**: 2 days may be enough. Your sensory calibration is already adjusted, you know how autos and metros work, and you can navigate crowds without stress.

**If you're a food person**: 4 days minimum. Delhi's food runs too deep for a quick tour. Old Delhi alone has enough eating to fill three days — kebab shops, sweet makers, spice markets, and chai stalls that have been operating for over a century.

**If you're a history person**: 4-5 days. Delhi has been built and destroyed seven times. The layers run from the 11th-century Tomar Rajputs through the Mughal empire to the British Raj to Lutyens' planned capital. Each layer has its own geography, and covering them all takes time.

## How Long Should I Spend in Delhi?

Most travellers should plan 3 days for Delhi. This covers Old Delhi's Mughal heritage, New Delhi's monuments and gardens, and at least one deeper experience like a food tour or heritage walk. Two days works if you're short on time but feels rushed. Four to five days lets you explore neighbourhoods, take day trips, and eat at a more relaxed pace.

## Is Delhi Worth More Than 2 Days?

Absolutely. Two days covers the highlights — Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, India Gate. But Delhi's real character lives in its food lanes, local markets, and neighbourhood streets. A third day lets you experience Hauz Khas, Nizamuddin, or Old Delhi's food culture properly rather than just photographing monuments.

## Can I See Delhi in 1 Day?

You can see the top 5-6 sights in one very full day starting at Red Fort and ending at Connaught Place. But you'll spend more time in transit than at any single location, and you won't have time for food experiences or neighbourhood exploration. One day gives you a snapshot, not a real visit.
