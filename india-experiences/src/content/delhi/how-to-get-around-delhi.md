  - question: "What is the best way to get around Delhi?"
    answer: "The Delhi Metro is the fastest and cheapest way to cover long distances. It connects most major tourist areas including Chandni Chowk, Connaught Place, Hauz Khas, and the airport. For door-to-door trips, Uber and Ola are reliable and air-conditioned. Auto rickshaws work for short distances under 5 km — just agree on the fare before you get in."
  - question: "Should I use buses or street taxis in Delhi?"
    answer: "No. Delhi's city buses are overcrowded, confusing for visitors, and don't have English signage on most routes. Street taxis — the black-and-yellow Ambassador cabs — are largely extinct, and the few that remain often refuse meters. Stick to the Metro, Uber/Ola, and auto rickshaws booked through apps."
  - question: "How much does transport cost in Delhi?"
    answer: "Metro fares range from ₹10-60 ($0.12-0.72) per journey. Uber and Ola rides across the city cost ₹150-400 ($1.80-4.80). Auto rickshaws should cost ₹30-150 ($0.36-1.80) for short trips. An average tourist spends ₹300-600 ($3.60-7.20) per day on transport."

**The Delhi Metro is the single best way to get around the city — it's fast, cheap, air-conditioned, and reaches every major tourist area.** For everything the Metro doesn't cover, Uber and Ola fill the gaps, and auto rickshaws work for short distances when you don't want to wait for a cab.

Delhi is enormous. The distance from Old Delhi in the north to Qutub Minar in the south is about 20 km, and traffic during rush hours (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM) can turn a 30-minute drive into 90 minutes. The Metro bypasses all of that.

## Delhi Metro: Your Primary Transport

The Metro network has over 250 stations across 12 lines. The stations you'll use most as a tourist:

- **Rajiv Chowk** — Connaught Place, the commercial centre
- **Chandni Chowk** — Old Delhi, Red Fort, street food
- **Kashmere Gate** — interchange hub for multiple lines
- **Hauz Khas** — South Delhi nightlife and Deer Park
- **Qutub Minar** — the 12th-century tower complex

Fares run ₹10-60 ($0.12-0.72) depending on distance. Trains come every 2-5 minutes during peak hours and every 5-8 minutes off-peak. The system runs from about 5:30 AM to 11:00 PM.

Read our full guide on [how to use the Delhi Metro](/delhi/how-to-use-delhi-metro/) for details on buying tokens, getting a smart card, and navigating security checks. Our [Delhi Metro map and tips](/delhi/delhi-metro-map-and-tips/) page covers the most useful routes for tourists.

## Uber and Ola: Door-to-Door

Both apps work well in Delhi. You'll need an Indian phone number to book — pick up a SIM card at the airport. Rides are metered through the app, so there's no haggling. A trip from Connaught Place to Hauz Khas costs around ₹200-300 ($2.40-3.60). Airport to central Delhi runs ₹400-600 ($4.80-7.20) depending on traffic and time.

**Uber Auto** and **Ola Auto** book you an auto rickshaw through the app at a fixed fare. This eliminates the biggest hassle with autos — negotiating the price. Use these for trips under 5 km where the Metro doesn't make sense.

Check our guide on [whether Uber is available in Delhi](/delhi/is-uber-available-in-delhi/) for tips on surge pricing, payment options, and getting a ride during rush hour.

## Auto Rickshaws: Short Trips Only

The green-and-yellow three-wheelers are everywhere. They're cheap and good for covering 1-5 km distances — say, from your hotel to the nearest Metro station or between two spots in the same neighbourhood.

The rules:

- **Always agree on a price before getting in.** Most drivers won't use the meter with tourists.
- **A fair price** is roughly ₹30 for the first 1.5 km, then ₹10-15 per km after that.
- **Don't take autos parked outside tourist monuments.** They charge 3-5x the going rate. Walk 200 metres away and hail a moving one, or use Uber Auto.
- **Carry small change.** Drivers rarely have change for ₹500 notes.

Auto rickshaws are open-air, which is great in winter but brutal in summer heat and during monsoon rains. They're also not the most comfortable ride if you're carrying luggage.

## What To Avoid

**City buses.** Delhi's DTC and cluster buses are cheap (₹5-15) but routes are poorly marked, buses are packed during rush hours, and there's minimal English signage. Unless you're a seasoned India traveller, they're more hassle than they're worth.

**Street taxis.** The old-style kaali-peeli (black and yellow) taxis are nearly gone. The few remaining ones rarely use meters and will overcharge. There's no reason to use them when Uber and Ola exist.

**Cycle rickshaws for long distances.** They're fine for a short ride through Old Delhi's lanes — that's actually a great experience. But don't take one for anything over 1-2 km. They're slow, and drivers will ask for tourist prices.

## A Typical Day's Transport

Here's what a day of sightseeing transport might look like:

1. **Metro** from your hotel area to Chandni Chowk — ₹20-40
2. **Cycle rickshaw** through Old Delhi lanes — ₹50-100
3. **Metro** from Chandni Chowk to Rajiv Chowk for lunch — ₹20
4. **Uber** from Connaught Place to Humayun's Tomb — ₹150-200
5. **Uber** back to hotel — ₹200-300

Total: roughly ₹450-660 ($5.40-8.00). That's a full day of transport for less than the cost of a single taxi ride in most European cities.
