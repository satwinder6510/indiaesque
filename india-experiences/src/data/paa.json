          "answer": "Oh, three days in Amritsar! You've picked the perfect amount of time to really soak in this incredible city. I remember my first visit there - the sensory overload was amazing, and honestly, three days gave me just enough time to fall completely in love with the place without feeling rushed.\n\nYour first day absolutely has to revolve around the Golden Temple, or Harmandir Sahib as locals call it. I'd suggest getting there early, around 6 AM, to catch the morning prayers and avoid the crowds. The experience of seeing that golden dome reflecting in the sacred pool at sunrise is something that'll stay with you forever. The temple is free to visit, but don't forget to cover your head and remove your shoes - they have free head coverings if you forget yours. Spend a good chunk of your morning there, maybe even volunteer at the langar (community kitchen) if you're feeling adventurous. The scale of feeding 100,000 people daily is mind-blowing.\n\nAfter lunch, walk through the narrow lanes of the old city. The bazaars around Hall Bazaar and Katra Jaimal Singh are perfect for picking up traditional juttis (those beautiful Punjabi shoes) for around ₹800-1500, or some gorgeous Phulkari embroidery. End your first day at Jallianwala Bagh, which is just a five-minute walk from the Golden Temple. The memorial is open until 6 PM, and the entry fee is only ₹10 for Indians, ₹30 for foreigners.\n\nDay two is all about the Wagah Border ceremony, but here's my insider tip - book your seats in advance through the online portal or ask your hotel to help. The VIP enclosure costs around ₹100 and is absolutely worth it for the better view. The ceremony starts at 4:15 PM in winter and 5:15 PM in summer, but reach there at least two hours early. The patriotic fervor and the synchronized marching between Indian and Pakistani guards is quite a spectacle. On your way back, stop at the Partition Museum - it's incredibly moving and gives you such important context about the region's history.\n\nFor your third day, I'd recommend a more relaxed pace. Start with Durgiana Temple, often called the Silver Temple, which is less crowded but equally beautiful. Then head to Ram Bagh, where Maharaja Ranjit Singh's summer palace stands. The gardens are lovely for a morning stroll, and entry is just ₹10.\n\nFood-wise, you absolutely cannot leave without trying kulcha at Kulcha Land near Lawrence Road - a full meal costs around ₹200. And please, please try the lassi at Ahuja Milk Bhandar near the Golden Temple. It's thick enough to stand a spoon in and costs only ₹60.\n\nTrust me, Amritsar has this way of wrapping itself around your heart. The warmth of the people, the spiritual energy, and that incredible food - you're going to have an absolutely wonderful time.",
