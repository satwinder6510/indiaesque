However, if you must visit, plan indoor activities during peak heat hours (11 AM-5 PM), stay in air-conditioned accommodations, and carry plenty of water.\n\n**Q: What should I buy in Jaipur markets?**\nA: Jaipur is famous for textiles (block-printed fabrics, bandhani), jewelry (especially silver and gemstones), handicrafts, pottery, leather goods, and traditional Rajasthani artwork. Johari Bazaar, Bapu Bazaar, and Tripolia Bazaar are the best shopping areas.\n\n**Q: Can you do a Jaipur to Agra day trip?**\nA: Yes, it's possible but challenging.
