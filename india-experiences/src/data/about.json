Independent spaces emerge outside the spotlight.\n\nIndiaesque exists to curate what's worth discovering — city by city.\n\nWe are an editorial travel platform spotlighting unique stays, offbeat places, and experiences that go beyond the obvious. We don't aim to list everything. We focus on what stands out."
