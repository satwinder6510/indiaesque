        "Indiaesque was born from a simple frustration: finding genuine, quality experiences in India shouldn't be this hard. Too many travel websites offer generic recommendations, outdated information, or hidden costs that only reveal themselves at checkout.",
        "We're travelers ourselves, and we wanted something different. A guide that tells you exactly what to expect, what you'll pay, and whether it's actually worth your time. No sponsored listings, no paid placements, just honest recommendations from people who've been there."

        "Every experience on Indiaesque is personally vetted. We visit, taste, walk, and explore before recommending anything. If it doesn't move us, it won't make our guide."
