  "notes": "Mumbai-specific notes: Key differentiators include being India's financial capital and Bollywood hub, second-largest Art Deco collection globally, unique local train system (avoid peak hours 8-10am, 5-8pm), Dharavi as Asia's largest slum with responsible tourism options, street food culture centered on vada pav and pav bhaji, monsoon season flooding issues (June-September), taxi meters are mandatory by law (unique in India), Marine Drive as 'Queen's Necklace', and neighborhoods like Colaba for heritage vs Bandra West for modern culture. Cultural considerations: respect for all religions in temples/dargahs, bargaining essential in markets (start at 30% quoted price), UPI payments widespread, crowds are unavoidable part of city charm, celebrity spotting common in Bandra/Juhu areas."
