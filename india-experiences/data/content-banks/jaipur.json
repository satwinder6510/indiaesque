  "notes": "Jaipur-specific considerations: Pink City architecture photography requires careful timing for best light. Gem scams are prevalent near major tourist sites - recommend certified dealers only. Heritage hotels offer authentic experiences but book early during peak season (October-March). Metro system is limited but growing - auto-rickshaws remain primary local transport. Composite tickets offer significant savings for multiple fort visits. Monsoon season (July-September) brings relief from heat but can affect outdoor sightseeing. Cultural sensitivity important at religious sites - modest dress mandatory. Street food is generally safe at busy stalls with high turnover. Bargaining is expected in all markets except fixed-price stores."
