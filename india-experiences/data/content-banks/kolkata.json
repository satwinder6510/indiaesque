  "notes": "Kolkata-specific notes: Key differentiators include being India's safest major city, cultural capital status, unique tram system (only in India), intellectual heritage (Tagore, literature), and distinctive Bengali cuisine. Avoid monsoon season (June-September) due to heavy rains and waterlogging. Best experienced through walking tours in heritage areas, food exploration, and cultural immersion. Prices generally lower than Mumbai/Delhi. Strong regional identity with Bengali language preference but English widely understood. Victoria Memorial and Howrah Bridge are iconic must-sees. Street food culture is exceptional but requires caution for international visitors. Durga Puja season (September-October) offers unique cultural experience but requires advance planning due to crowds."
